            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is high time, there being already publiſhed, many Treatiſes in this kind, for us to diſcharge our conſciences for the good of the Nation, we have peruſed all that have been in this nature in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and finde them ſtrangely defficient, ſo crowded with unneceſſary notions, and dangerous miſtakes, that we thought it fit to give you warning of them, that for the future the unfortunate practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, may prevent the <hi>almoſt guilt,</hi> of the crying ſin of murder.</p>
            <p>It is Admirable to us, that our Countrey ſhould be ſo much delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to build all their practice upon ſuch Authors that have not at all conduced to any conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb facs="tcp:111778:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> in this ſo neceſſary uſefull Art as the preſerving of man-kind; Alas! how many miſerable volumes have theſe late times brought forth. Not to diſparage any that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but in ſo weighty a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this, we muſt ſtand upon our integrity, There hath been a reaſonable intention in the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers of ſome books, <hi>viz. The Birth of man,</hi> the moſt antient, but very much unfurniſhed; as alſo the books of <hi>child-birth, The expert Midwife,</hi> the worſt that have been written in that kind, in French; and its almoſt or miracle to us that <hi>Mr. Culpepper,</hi> a man whom we otherwaies reſpect, ſhould deſcend ſo low, as to borrow his imperfect Treatiſe from thoſe wretched volumes, ſome of which are before mentioned, and we muſt deale faithfully with you, that, that ſmall peice of his, intituled, The dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory for <hi>Midwifes,</hi> is the moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately defficient of them all, except he writ it for neceſſity he could cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely have never been ſo ſinfull to have expoſed it to the light.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſtian Reader, to give
<pb facs="tcp:111778:4"/> thee a true information of what we have here done for thy good, we ſhal not only Juſtifie from our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, but fully demonſtrate from the writings of the beſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, both of the <hi>French, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and other Nations; and we muſt cleerly confeſſe, that we are highly obliged to the incomparable labours of that moſt famous woman of the world, <hi>Madam Long Bourgeo,</hi> late Midwife to the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> the praiſes that we read of all thoſe that ever heard of her, are not ſo much a flouriſh as truth, for her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſolid experiences, and her witneſſes have been all of the moſt emminent perſons of <hi>France;</hi> and not only of her, but as we have already expreſt of the moſt excellent known men or women of this Art of other Countries; it's upon this account that we break the barriers, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand the brunt of all cenſures.</p>
            <p>The chief occaſion of this book, is to make it a great exemplary, and Schoole, where medicine married to the Midwives induſtrie, may teach every one the admirable effects of
<pb facs="tcp:111778:5"/> the Divinity of this art of Midwifery.</p>
            <p>And now knowing Reader that the Receipts herein contain'd, which have ever had happy ſucceſes, are not made publicke to the world on any other deſigne then or the aſſiſtance of ſuch perſons whom either the want of fortune or opportunity deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch ſudden helps, neither can we be without bleeding hearts, if we but conſider how many have been loſt by the unskilfulneſſe of thoſe that attempted this great work; nor ſhould we have proſtrated our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and private experiences, but to correct the frequent miſtake of moſt <hi>Midwifes,</hi> who reſting to bold upon the common way of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering women, neglect all the wholeſome and profitable rules of Art, which might concern them in the occult diſeaſes of women, as alſo of the Anotomical parts of the Body. Thus having diſcharged our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, we have no more to write, but referre you to the book it ſelf, deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bleſſing of God on theſe our faithful endeavours, we are the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well wiſhers of your good,</p>

                  <p>AMong the Spermatic veſſels are to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red firſt, two veins, and two arteries: theſe are carried downward from the ſmall guts to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and are much bigger in men then they are in women.</p>
                  <p>The original of theſe veines is not alwayes the ſame, for commonly the right vein riſeth out of the <hi>hollow veine,</hi> a little below the ſource or original of the Emulgent; but the leaſt takes his original from the lower part of the Emulgent it ſelf. Yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it hath a branch carried to it from the trunk of the hollow vein.</p>
                  <p>The middle part of theſe veines runs directly through the Loyns, reſting upon the Lumbal Muſcle, a thin Membrane only intervening; and thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gone about half its journey, it branches out and diſtributes it ſelf to the near adjoyning filmy parts of the body. The uttermoſt part of theſe veſſels is carried beyond the Midriff to the Stones, yet do they not paſs through the Peritonaeum, but deſcends with a ſmall nerve and the muſcle called Cremaſter, through the Duplicity of the Midriffe; when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches neer the ſtones it is joyned with an artery; and now theſe veſſels which were before a little ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered one from the other, are by a film riſing from the Peritoneum cloſed up, and bound both together, and ſo twiſting up like the young tendrils of a vine, they are carried to the end of the ſtones.</p>

                  <p>THe uſe of thoſe veſſels which are called the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of preparation is chiefly to attract out of the hollow vein, or left Emulgent, the moſt pure and exquiſitely concocted bloud, which is moſt apt to be converted into ſeed; which they contain and prepare, giving unto it a certain rude form of ſeed in thoſe parts that lie as it were in certain pleights or folds, which they do by a peculiar property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to them.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111778:15"/>
                  <p>Another uſe of them is gathered by their ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for as they are now ſcituated, that is to ſay, the right vein coming from the hollow vein, and the left from the Emulgent, this inconvenience is avoided, that the left vein is not forced to paſs over the great artery, and ſo be in danger of breaking, by reaſon of the ſwift motion of the artery. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there being a neceſſity that male and female ſhould be begot, it is fit that there ſhould be ſeed proper for the generation of both ſexes, whereof ſome muſt be hotter and ſome muſt be colder; and therefore nature hath ſo ordered it, that the hotter ſeed ſhould proceed from the right vein for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of man, and the colder from the left for the generation of females. The left vein hath alſo this property to draw from the Emulgent the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and leſs pure bloud, to the intent that the ſerous humour might ſtir up venery by its ſalt and acrimonius ſubſtance; and therefore it is obſerved that thoſe who have the left ſtone bigger are moſt full of ſeed, and moſt prone to venery.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of the <hi>Paraſtatae</hi> is this, to contain the bloud and ſtay it in their windings and wrinkled bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and by power received from the ſtones to change the colour of the bloud.</p>

                  <p>THe ſtones are in number two, very ſeldome one, and much ſeldomer three or four. The ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtones in men, is without the Midriff, at the root of the yard under the belly, and that for two cauſes, to keep men more chaſte; it being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111778:15"/> that thoſe creatures which carry their ſtones within their bodies are more ſalacious, and bring forth in greater numbers.</p>
                  <p>Their bigneſs is not always alike in all creatures, but in men as big as a Pigeons egg, or as a ſmall Hens egg; and commonly the left is bigger then the right.</p>
                  <p>In the Anatomy of the ſtones divers things are to be conſidered. Their Tunicles or the skins in which they are wrapt, as well thoſe which are common to both, as thoſe which are particular to either, next the muſcles, then the ſubſtance of which they are compoſed: and laſtly the veſſels which are diſpear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the body of the ſtones.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Tunicles of the ſtones.</head>
                  <p>THe Teſticles are wrapt up in divers coverings, about the number of which there hath been great diſſention. But they are now reduced to five, whereof two are common, and are called <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and <hi>Dartos,</hi> three particular, the names of which are <hi>Elytroydes, Erythroides,</hi> and <hi>Epididy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe, which is like a ſatchel or purſe, and is common to both, conſiſts of a skin and a cuticle. This contains the two ſtones like a purſe, and is obvious to the touch. The skin of this part differs from any other part of the skin which covers the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for whereas that is ſtretched out and ſpred cloſe over the whole body, this is more looſe, and made to ſtretch out or to be wrinkled up together as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, that is as the ſtones either aſcend or deſcend:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111778:16"/> they aſcend commonly in the time of conjunction, they deſcend in febers, weakneſs of the Teſticles, or by reaſon of old age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note>The ſecond is called Dartos, becauſe it is eaſily ſeparated from the others. In this the teſticles lie as it were in a neſt, wrapping them about more cloſe then the Scrotum doth. It takes its Originall from the fleſhie Pannicle, which though it be thinner here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts then in any other part of the body, yet is it full of little Veines and arteries.</p>
                  <p>The proper Tunicles<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> are firſt the Elytroides which is alſo called Vaginalis by reaſon it ſupplyes the office of a ſheath. It takes its originall from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Peritoneum, for where the ſpermatic veſſells paſs, they do not at all bruſe the Peritoneum, but carie it downe to the ſtones, and ſo conſtitute or make this Tunicle. To know this Tunicle, and the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of it is very neceſſary for Phyſick, becauſe that hollowneſs which the Proceſſeſs of the Peritoneum do make for the paſſage of the ſpermatic veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, is ſomtimes dilated as far as the beginning or ſource of this Tunicle, and both the ſmall guts and the caule fall down upon the Teſticles, which is the cauſe of that kind of birſtneſs which by the Phyſitians is called Enterocle. This Tunicle grows to that which is called Dartos, being ioyned to it by many nervous fibres. Underneath this is the Tunicle called Erythro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ides, or the red Tunicle; ſo called from the multitude of red veines which are ſprinkled up and down in it. It riſes from the other membranes and is encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without by the firſt proper tunicle.</p>
                  <p>The third, and that which immediately compaſſeth the ſtones, is that which is called Epididymis: it is white, thick and ſtrong, to preſerve the ſoft and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111778:16"/> looſe ſubſtance of the ſtones. It riſeth ftom the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of the ſeminal veſſels, being the thickeſt of all the Tunicles, and hath ſome few veines ſcattered up and dovne in it.</p>

                  <p>TO keep the ſtones from oppreſſing, or ſtretching over much the paſſages of the ſeminal veſſels, Nature hath provided them two Muſcles for them to hang by, on both ſides one, in form oblonge and ſlender.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Muſcles derive their original from a thick membrane which is joyned to the hanch bone in the further part of that region, where the hair grows,<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of theſe Muſcels.</note> and is faſtened to this bone with certaine fleſhie and ſtraight fibers; where the oblique Muſcles of the Abdomen or Mideriff end, thence reaching down upon the ſuperiour members of the Teſticles, they are extended through the whole length of that round body.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Muſcles are never ſeen in women being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uſeleſs, becauſe their ſtones are not pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but are encloſed within their bodies.</p>

                  <p>THe ſubſtance of the ſtones is glandulous or ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelly, white, ſoft, looſe, ſpongy, and hollow; having ſundrie veſſels diſperſed through them.</p>
                  <p>Now although the ſubſtance of the Teſticles be moſt ſoft and moiſt, yet doth not this moiſtneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute

Theſe fibres alſo ſeeme to be of a different ſubſtance from that of the ſtones, being only cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which the fleſh of the ſtones, as the fibres of the Muſcles are inwardly nervous, but coverd over which the fleſh of the Muſcles. Theſe fibres again differ in this, that the fibres of the Teſticles are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but the fibres of the Teſticles full and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall. Theſe fibres are ſaid to come from the ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick veſſels, and thence branch themſelves forth through the Teſticles, by which that part of the ſeed which is over and above what ſerves for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the teſticles, as drawn forth and kept for procreation.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the Temper of the ſtones, they would ſooner be thought cold then hot, if that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime</hi> were true, that all white things are cold, and all red things hot. Nothwithſtanding, becauſe nature is known to abhor all coldneſs in the work of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; Therefore we muſt preſume to affirme the temper of the ſtones to be hot, for they always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with blood, and a pure ſpirit, that can never be whichout heat: Beſides that heat is required for the concoction of this blood; and the changing it into ſeed; yet is it very temperate, as appeares by the ſoftneſs of the ſubſtance, for as coldneſs and drineſs is the cauſe of hardneſs, ſo heat and moiſture is the cauſe of ſoftneſs.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs we are to underſtand this, that the temper of the ſtones is not alike in all, for in ſome they are far colder then in others. And therefore theſe who have hot teſticles are more ſalacious and prone to venereal actions, having the places neer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111778:17"/> much more hairie, and their teſticles much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then others. Thoſe that have their teſticles cold, find every thing contrary.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt heat is in the right teſticle, becauſe it receives more pure and hotter blood from the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low veine and the great Artery, the left colder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it receives a more inpure and ſerous bloud from the Emulgent veine.</p>

                  <p>THe action and uſe of the Teſticles, is to Generate ſeed, a gift which they obtaine from an inbred qualitie which nature hath beſtowed upon them. For the bloud being received by the ſpermatic veſſels, and there beginning to change it's colour, is by and by received by the deferent veſſels, or the veſſels which carry the bloud ſo prepared to the Teſticles, where it is for a while contained, and afterwards being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſtones is by them made ſeed, and the laſt work perfected. And it may with more eaſineſs be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the ſeed is generated by the ſtones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every like is ſaid to generate its like; now the ſubſtance of the Teſticles is very like the ſeed it ſelf, that is white moiſt and viſcous. Whether the ſtones are the onely efficient cauſes of the ſeed, is not here to be diſputed, being onely a nice point, and no way profitable; we ſhall rather with ſilence adhere to that opinion, which affirmes the function of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles to be the generation of the ſeed, which is the moſt likely, and proceed to the next.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Concerning the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilitie of the Teſticles and their parts.</head>
                  <p>THe ſtructure of the Teſticles being thus known, It remaines that wee ſhew you their uſe. This is firſt diſcovered from their ſituation. For of thoſe creatures that have ſtones, ſome have them in their bodyes, as all Fowl, others have them without, though not pendent; others have them hanging downward, as men. Men therefore have their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles without their bodys for two cauſes; firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is required that the Teſticles of the male ſhould be bigger and hotter then thoſe of the female, ſo that it were impoſſibe for them to be contained with the body, becauſe of their quantity. Beſides, the ſeed of the male being the effective original of the creature, and therefore hotteſt, it is alſo required that the ſeed ſhould be more abundant then could be contained in the Teſticles, were they placed within the body; for the ſeminarie paſſages muſt have bin leſs, and the veines themſelves would not have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded ſuch plentie of matter as now they doe.</p>
                  <p>The motion of the Teſticles is alſo to be conſidered; by which they move ſomtimes upward and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times downward. The one of theſe motions which is made upward is voluntary, as being made by the muſcles, but the motion downward is a forced mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not happening without the laxitie of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; the Teſticles through their own weight falling downwards. Theſe muſcles are called Cremaſteres, their uſe being to draw up the Teſticles to ſhorten the way for the Ejaculation of the ſeed, as alſo to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111778:18"/> keep the veſſels from being diſtended too far by the weight of the Teſticles.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of the Tunicles is now to be ſpoken of, and firſt of that which is outermoſt, and is called by the Latines <hi>Scrotum,</hi> being the purſe wherein the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles are contained. It is made to wrinkle it ſelf up and to let it ſelf looſe that it may be large enough for the Teſticles when they ſwell with plenty of ſeed, and to wrinkle up again when the Teſticles, being emptied and ſo becoming leſs, are drawn upward. The other coates or tunicles alſo made for the defence of the ſtones, but ſo thin and light, that they ſhould not oppreſs the ſtones with their weight; that which is called <hi>Erythroides</hi> hath many veines for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Adjacent parts. The Epididymis, was made to wrap the teſticle round about, leſt the Humid matter of the teſticle ſhould flow about and conſequently be waſted.</p>

                  <p>THat paſſage which comes from the head of the teſticles to the root of the yard, is called the Ejaculatorie veſſel. This, as I ſaid before, riſes from the head of the teſticles, and joyning downward to the teſticle deſcends to the bottome, and thence being reflexed again, and annext to the preparing veſſel, it returns againe to the head of the teſticle, from thence it proceeds upward from the Teſticle till it touch the bone of the ſmall guts, ſtill keeping cloſe to the preparing veſſel, till it pierce the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Hypogaſtrium. Thence tending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through the hollowneſs of the hip, it ſlydes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111778:19"/> the bladder and the ſtreight gut, till it reach the glandulous <hi>Proſtatae</hi> or foreſtanders, and fix it ſelf at the foot or root of the yard, and there end. It is not all one at the beginning, and at the end, for at the beginning, while it remains among the tunicles of the teſticles, it is full of windings and turnings; neer the end it hath many little bladders like to warts.</p>
                  <p>Now we muſt underſtand that theſe ſeminarie veſſels doe not onely containe the ſeed, but they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and concoct it, having a ſeminifie or ſeed-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king qualitie, which they borrow from the <hi>Teſticles.</hi> There are other uſes of theſe ſeminary veſſels: for neer the original of this veſſel, that is to ſay, the head of the teſticles many ſmall paſſages, or as it were conduit-pipes, do ſtretch themſelves forward into the body of the teſticle, into which the genital ſeed that remaines is remitted, and alſo drawn or ſucked from thoſe paſſages; this ſeminarie paſſage is at length wound above the teſticles, adjoyning all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, but no where incorporated into the body of the Teſticle, unleſs at the bottom, in which place it is thought that the ſeed doth again inſinuate it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the teſticles through thoſe hollow fibres: being thence propagated and continually making ſupply to the ſtones.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted alſo, that theſe veſſels while they move to the Root of the yard, do not go by ſtreigth paſſages, which would be then very ſhort, but by crooked windings and turnings, make the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages as long as may be, that they may have longer time to containe and prepare the ſeed.</p>

                  <p>AT the end of the deferent veſſels on both ſides, are certain little bladders, knit and joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and placed between the bladder and the right gut; the laſt of which, together which the ſeminarie veſſels, is terminated in the proſtatae or foreſtanders by a little channel.</p>
                  <p>Theſe bladders have two ſeveral uſes, for they doe not only ſtriengthen the ſeminarie veſſels where they end, but alſo ſeem to be the ſtores and maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of the ſeed. They are many, that every time a man uſes the act of venerie, he may have a new ſupply of matter from theſe ſeveral veſicles. Thus that which is next the yard being firſt diſburdened, the ſecond is the next time emptied, and ſo till all the ſtore is ſpent; and were it not for theſe veſicles, a man could not lye which a woman more then once.</p>
                  <p>In theſe veſſels, ſuch is the propenſitie of nature to propagate, let the body be never ſo much emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, there is always found a leſſer or greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of ſeed. They are hollow and round to containe a greater quantitie of ſeed, they are alſo full of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, that they may be contracted or extended as the plenty of ſeed requires; they are crooked and full of windings, and turnings, that the ſeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained may not eaſily ſlip out.</p>

                  <p>THe glandulous proſtatae or foreſtanders: are two little teſticles as it were ſeated at the foot of the yard, a little above the ſphinctere of the Urinarie veſſels, they are wrapt about with a membrane, which doth alſo cloath the ſeminarie veſſels and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiicles: before and behind they ſeeme more flat, on the ſides they are more round, they have a ſubſtance like other kernels, looſe and ſpungie, only they differ from them by reaſon of their whiteneſs and hardneſs; they are endued which an exquiſite feeling, to ſtir up a greater deſire of copulation. Theſe Glandulae or kernels have certaine pores that open themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ureter through which the ſeed, theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders being ſqueezed by the lower Muſcles of the yard, diſtils into the yard.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of theſe kernels is partly to beget an oylie, fat, and ſlipperie ſubſtance, with which the urinarie paſſage is ſometimes anointed, to defend it from the acrimony both of the Seed and Urin, and to keep it always moiſt.</p>
                  <p>The other uſe is taken from the name of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatae, which word in the ſingular number ſignifies a tutor or defender, for they are there placed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and ſtrengthen the ends of the different veſſels, leſt by over much diſtention of the yard, the temi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary veſſel ſhould be either burſt or moved out of their places.</p>
                  <p>They have a third uſe, for being placed between the bladder and the right gut, they ſerve inſtead of cuſhions for the veſſel to reſt upon, and to guard
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111778:20"/> them from all compreſſion: Hence it hapned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that thoſe who are very much bound in their bodies while they ſtrain themſelves over-vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do now and then void a kind of ſeed, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by a violent compreſſion of thoſe parts.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIII</hi> Of the ſtructure of the Yard.</head>
                  <p>THe ſtructure of the Yard is not unknown, that is to ſay, at the root of the ſhare bone in the hinder part of the Hypogaſtrion or lower part of the belly, where the hair grows, which bone is called <hi>Os pubis.</hi> Though the greateſt part of it is not pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent without, but adjoyning to the <hi>podex</hi> is ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted near the joyning of the ſhare bone, being faſt knit to it in the <hi>perinaeum,</hi> or ſpace between the cods and the fundament; the other part is pendent and is ſeen hanging outward. This ſcituation is moſt appropriated to the manner of the act of generation, uſual and peculiar to men, who do not couple after the manner of beaſts. The figure of it is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner round, though not exactly, broader in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part which is called the back of the Yard.</p>
                  <p>The Thickneſs and Longitude of the Yard is ſo much as is required for procreation,<note place="margin">The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it.</note> yet it is not ſo long as in many other creatures. Yea, and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men there is a very great diverſity, little men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part, beſt provided in that part; It is alſo thought, that there is a national difference, as to the bigneſs of this member; it being a general received opinion, that the often uſe of Venery doth increaſe the quantity of it in all dimenſions.</p>
                  <p>The Yard will alſo be longer, if the Navel ſtrings
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111778:21"/> are not bound up, or knit too cloſe by the midriffe, in children that are newly born; but at ſome diſtance from the navel: This happens by reaſon of the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment coming fron the navel to the bottom of the bladder; which if it be too much abbreviated, draws up the bladders, and conſequently ſhortens the yard; but if the navel ſtring be left at a longer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Urac hos is inlarged, and conſequently the yard hath more liberty to extend it ſelf, and therefore the midwifes are from hence advertiſed, that they do not ſpoil the harveſt of Generation, by cutting the ſithe too ſhort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Yard.</note>As to the ſubſtance of the yard, it is not of a bony ſubſtance, as in dogs wolphs or foxes; for ſo it would become always hard and erected, and hinder men from all buſineſs but the act of venerie. Neither is it griſly, for ſo it could neither erect it ſelf, nor flag, when occaſion required; neither is it full of veines, for ſo it could not be emptied and repleted on ſuch a ſuddain as often happens; beſides that tunicle of the veins are ſo thin that they could not ſuffer ſo great a diſſention; neither can it be full of Arteries, becauſe it wants a continual pulſation; neither can it conſiſt of nerves, becauſe they having no hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be extended and looſened, as it muſt of neceſſity happen to the yard. It is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the yard ſhould have ſuch a ſubſtance as is not peculiar to any other part of the body. It is therefore to be underſtood that there do concur to the framing of the yard, two nervous bodies, the paſſage for the Urine, which is called Ureſtua, the glary or nut of the yard, four muſcles, the veſſels and the skin.</p>
                  <p>Here doth ariſe a queſtion, why the yard hath not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111778:21"/> any far; which is in brief this; becauſe that there ſhould be no hinderance to the perfect ſence of the yard, which could of neceſſity not be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if that member were ſubject to any obeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the fat being ſubject to be melted by frica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

This skin that turns back is called the preputium; becauſe that part in circumciſion was cut away, with which prepuce, the nut of the yard is covered.</p>
                  <p>The Glans or nut of the yard is a fleſhy part, ſoft, thin, repleat with bloud and ſpirits;<note place="margin">The nut of the yard.</note> endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an exquiſite ſence; ſomething ſharp and acute at the end.

                  <p>The greateſt part of the yard is conſtituted by two nervous bodies, on both ſides one,<note place="margin">The two nervous bodies.</note> which terminate both together in the nut. They riſe from a twofold original, leaning or reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111778:22"/> the hip, under the ſhare bone; whence as from a ſure foundation they go on till they arrive at the nut of the yard.</p>
                  <p>They conſiſt of a double ſubſtance, the firſt is nervous,<note place="margin">Their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> hard and thick; the inner part black, looſe, ſoft, thin and ſpungy. It is called the <hi>Nervous pipe.</hi> Theſe two bodies are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a certain membrane, thin, yet ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, which is ſtrengthened by certain over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart fibers, being there placed in the likeneſs of a weavers ſhuttle: and though in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal they are ſeperated the one from the other, that there might remain ſome certain ſpace for the ureter; yet they are joyned together about the middle of the ſhare bone; where they loſe about the third part of their nervous ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The interiour ſubſtance, which is wrapt about by the exteriour nervous ſubſtance,<note place="margin">The Ureter.</note> hath this worthy obſervation, that there appears ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the whole length of it, a thin and tender artery, proportionable to the bigneſs of the body; which is diffuſed through the whole looſe ſubſtance of the yard, reaching as far the root of the yard. Beſides theſe two, there is another body which lies between theſe two, as proper, or rather more peculiar to the yard then they are. This is a pipe placed at the inferiour part of the yard, being called the Vre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though it be a paſſage as proper to the ſeed, as to the urine; which is encompaſſed by the two fore-mentioned bodies. This is a certain Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel produced in length, and running through
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111778:22"/> the middle of thoſe nervous bodies, conſiſting of the ſame ſubſtance that they do, being looſe, thick, ſoft, and tender; every way equal from the neck of the bladder to the nut of the yard, ſaving that it is a little wider at the beginning, then it is toward the place where it ends, which is at the head of the glans or nut of the yard.</p>

                  <p>This is further to be noted in this place, that in the channel, where it is joyned to the glans, together with the nervous bodies,<note place="margin">Note.</note> there is a little kind of cavern, in which ſometimes either putrid ſeed, or any other corroding humour, as happens in the gonorrhaea, being collected, is the cauſe of ulcers in that part, the cauſe of very great pain; and it many times alſo comes to paſs, that there is a certain little piece of fleſh which grows out of this ulcer, that oftentimes ſtops up the paſſages of the urine.</p>
                  <p>To the ſtructure of the yard,<note place="margin">The Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles of the Yard.</note> there do more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over concur two pair of muſcles, one more ſhort and thick, proceeding from a part of the hip, near the beginning of the yard, and being of a fleſhy ſubſtance. The uſe of theſe two muſcles, is to ſuſtain the yard in the erection;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:111778:23"/> and to bend the fore-part of the yard, which is to be inſerted into the womb: the other pair is longer, and riſes from the ſphincter of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, where they are endued with a more fleſhy ſubſtance, being in length full as long as the yard; under which they are carried down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ending at the ſides of the ureter, about the middle of the yard. Their uſe is to dilate the ureter, both at the time of making water, and at the time of conjunction; leſt it ſhould be ſtopped up, by the repletion of the nervous bodies, and ſo ſtop up the paſſage of the ſeed. They are alſo thought to keep the yard firm, leſt it ſhould lean too much to either ſide, and alſo to preſs out the ſeed out of the proſtatae or foreſtanders.</p>

Theſe veins ſwelling with a frothy bloud and ſpirit, erect the yard. There are alſo certain nerves which ſcatter themſelves from the pith or marrow of the holy bone quite through the yard, bringing with them the cauſe of that pleaſure and delight, which is perceived in the erection of the yard.</p>

And is alſo placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the thighes, for the greater ſtrengthning of it in the act of copulation; Neither is this the only ſtrength which it hath, for at the lower part it appears more fleſhie, which fleſh is altogether muſcly, for the greater ſtrength thereof. Neither
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111778:24"/> is it only contented with this Muſclie fleſh, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too muſcles alſo for the ſame purpoſe, on both ſides to poiſe it even in the act of erection; which though they are but little, yet are they exceeding ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>The figure of the yard is not abſolutly round, but broader on the upper ſide, leſt it ſhould be hindered by the convexity of the ſuperior part, in the caſting forth of the ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the biggneſs of the yard, it is by moſt eſtemed to be of a juſt length, when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the bredth of nine thumbs.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the uſe of the parts conſtituting the Yard.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt thing in the conſtitution of the yard, that offeres it ſelf to view, is the skin, which is long and looſe, by reaſon that the yard which is ſometimes to be extended, &amp; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to fall downe againe, ſo requires it. The extremity of the skin is ſo ordered, that it ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times covers the glans, and ſomtimes draws back; that whilſt it covers the nut of the yard, it may defend the yard from frication, or provoking the motion of the ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this skin in the act of copulation, ſhuts up the mouth of the womb, and hinders the ingreſs of the cold air. Concerning the two nervous bodyes, conſtituting the ſubſtance of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111778:24"/> the yard; their uſe is for the vital ſpirit to run through the thin ſubſtance of them, and fill the yard with ſpirits. Moreover by their thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they doe prevent the two haſtie empting and flying out of the ſpirits, which are to ſtay in, for the greater and longer erection of the yard.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of the Ureter is for the paſſage of ſeed and urine through it. The ſubſtance of the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is much the ſame with the two former bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys; the inſide being more thin and looſe, the outſide more nervous and thick; which is ſo ordained, that it may be more apt to be erected with the yard. It goes forward from the place where it begins, to the end of the ſpermatick veſſels, and the neck of the blader, and the warty foreſtanders where There ariſes a thin and tender membrane, which the Chirurgions ought to take a great deale of care leaſt they break, while they thruſt their ſiringes toward thoſe parts; It is endued with an exquiſite ſenſe to ſtir up plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and venereal deſire.</p>
                  <p>As to tbe ſubſtance of the Glans,<note place="margin">The uſe of the Glans.</note> it is the ſame with that of the yard; only it is not envelop'd with any nervous body. For this ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted and increaſed, but not hardened; leſt it ſhould injure the bone of the womb, by rubbing too hard upon it.</p>
                  <p>The figure of the <hi>Glans</hi> is ſuch that at the top where it is moſt acute, it hath a hole for the iſſuing forth both of ſeed and Urine, which part coming to the mouth of the wombe, caſts
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111778:25"/> the ſeed into that concavitie, at which time the neck of the wombe with her overthwart fibres, ſeems to take hold and embrace the glans; and that it might take the better hold, nature hath framed a round Circle at the bottom of the yard, for that purpoſe, with a convenient jeting out round about from the body of the yard; by the benefit of which circle, the ſeed is kept in the womb, and not ſuffered to flye out. Laſtly, the Glans is ſo conſtituted, as if all the actions of the yard conſiſted in the Glans; whether in the act of erection, or copulation; or as to the pleaſure which a man perceives that lies all in this place.</p>

                  <p>PRreſently behinde the wings, before we go far inward in the middle of the cleft, there do appear four knobs of fleſh, being placed in a quadrangular form one againſt the other; they are ſaid to reſemble Myrtle berries in form. In this place is inſerted the orifice of the bladder, which opens it ſelf into the fiſſure, to caſt forth the Urine into the common channel. Now leſt any cold air or duſt, or any ſuch thing ſhould enter into the bladder after the voiding of the Urine, one of theſe knobs is ſeated ſo, that it ſhuts the urinary paſſage. The ſecond is right oppoſite to the firſt, the other two collateral. They are round in virgins, but they hang flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when virginity is loſt.</p>
                  <p>The lipps of the womb being gently ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the neck of the womb is to be ſeen,<note place="margin">The neck of the womb.</note> in which two things are to be obſerved; the neck it ſelfe, or the Channel, and the Hymen, which is there placed: by the neck of the womb, is underſtood the Channel, which is between the ſaid knobs, and the inner bone of the womb; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the yard like a ſheath; the ſubſtance<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> of it is ſinewie, and a little ſpungie, that it may be dilated; In this concavitie there are certaine folds or orbicular pleights; theſe are made by

In old women it becomes more hard and griſly. Now though this channel be ſomthing writhed and crooked when it falls and ſinkes downe, yet in time of the flowers and copulation, or in time of travel it is erected and extended, and this over-great extenſion in women that bring forth, is the cauſe of that great pain in child-bed.</p>

                  <p>BEtween the Duplicitie of the two tunicles, that conſtitute the neck of the womb, there are many veines and arteries that run a long; ariſing from thoſe veſſels, that deſcend on both ſides to the thighs, and are inſerted into the ſide of the neck of the womb: the great quantity and bigneſs of them deſerves admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">The cauſe of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the veſſels.</note> for they are much bigger then the nature and openneſs of the place ſeems to require.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this is two fold; firſt becauſe it being requiſite for the neck of the bladder to be fil'd with abundance of ſpirits, &amp; to be extended and dilated for the better taking hold of the yard; there is required a great heat for theſe kind of motions, which growing more intenſe by the act of frication, doth conſume a great quantitie of moiſture, ſo that great veſſels are requiſite, and onely able to make that continual ſupply that is needfull.</p>
                  <p>There is another cauſe of the longneſs of theſe veſſels, which is this; becauſe that the monthly purgations are poured through thoſe veines; for the flowers muſt not come onely out of the womb, but out of the neck of the womb alſo: whence it happens,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that women with child do ſomtimes continue their purgations, becauſe that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111778:28"/> though the wombe be ſhut up, yet the paſſages in the neck of the womb are open.</p>

                  <p>This is the humor with which women doe moiſten the top of a mans yard; not the ſeed but a humor proper to the place, voided out by the womb.</p>

The neck of the womb is joyned by its own ſubſtance, and by certaine membranes to the ſhare bone and the ſacred bone.</p>
                  <p>As to the bigneſs<note place="margin">The big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> of it, that varies according to the age, conſtitution of the body, and uſe of venerie. For it is much greater in women that have brought forth, then in thoſe that are with child, and after the birth, for the moſt part it exceeds the bigneſs of the bladder; but in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins it is for the moſt part equal to the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>It is of a ſubſtance ſo thick as that it exceeds a thumbs bredth in thickneſs, which after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is ſo far from decreaſing, that it increaſes ſtill to a greater bulk and proportion.</p>

                  <p>There are two little veines which are carried from the ſpermatick veſſels to the bottom of the wombe; and two greater from the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtricks, which go not onely to the bottom, but to the neck. The mouth of theſe veines pierce as farr as the inward concavitie; in which place the extremities of them are called <hi>Aceta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula;</hi>

                  <p>It hath two Arteries<note place="margin">The Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> on both ſides, the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and the Hypogaſtrick, which every where doe accompany the veines.</p>
                  <p>The womb hath alſo divers little Nerves knit together in forme of a net, which are carried not only to the interior part of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the womb, but alſo to the neck, and as far as the privities themſelves; and that cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſence and pleaſure; for which cauſe there is a great ſympathy between the womb and the head.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo further to be noted,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that the womb in its ſituation is not fixed and immoveable, but moveable, by reaſon of two ligaments which hang on both ſides, from the ſhare bone, and piercing through the Peritonaeum; are joyned to the bone it ſelf, ſo that it ſomtimes happens that through thoſe holes of the Peritonaeum, which give paſſage to theſe ligaments being looſned, either the Omentum or Call, or the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111778:29"/> Entrailes, doe ſwell outwardly, and cauſe the burſtneſs either of the Caule, or of the Guts, and ſometimes it happens by reaſon of the looſnes of thoſe ligaments, that the womb is moved with ſuch a force, that it falls down; and in the act of Copulation is moved up and downe; ſomtimes it moves upward, that ſome women doe affirme that it aſcends as high as their ſtomach. Now though the womb be one continued body, yet is it divided into the <hi>mouth,</hi> and the bottom.</p>
                  <p>The bottom of the womb is called all that which by ſtill aſſending ſtretches it ſelf from the internal orifice to the end; being narrow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Mouth, but dilating it ſelf by little and little, till it come at the entrailes.</p>
                  <p>The mouth of the womb, is that narrowneſs between the neck and the bottom; it is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and tranſverſe Orifice; but where it opens it ſelfe, orbicular, and round, the Circumference very thick and of an exquiſite feeling; and if this mouth be out of order, and be troubled with ſchirrus, brawn or over-fatneſs; over-moiſture, or relaxation, it is the cauſe of barrenneſs. In thoſe that are big with child, there uſes to ſtick to this orifice; a thick viſcous glutinous matter, that the parts moiſtened may be the more eaſily opened. For in the deliverie, this <hi>mouth</hi> is opened after a very ſtrange and miraculous manner, ſo that according to the bigneſs of the birth, it ſuffers an equal dilatation, from the bottom of the womb to the privy member.</p>

                  <p>There are two arteries<note place="margin">The Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> alſo, on both ſides one, which grows from the Aorta; theſe both bring vital bloud for the work of generation.</p>

                  <p>THe deferent veſſels are two blind paſſages, on both ſides one, nothing differing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the ſpermatick veines. They riſe in one part from the bottom of the womb, neither doe they reach from their other extremitie, either to the ſtone or to any other part, but are ſhut up, and unpaſſable, adhering to the womb, juſt as the the blind gut adheres to the Colon; but winding halfe way about the ſtones, are every waies remote from them, no where touching them, onely are tied to them with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine membranes, not unlike the winges of Bats, through which certaine veines and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, being produced from the ſtones, doe run; and end in theſe paſſages: where they begin, at the bottom of the womb, they are hollow and large, but as they proceed further on, they grow narrower, till near their end they do again obtain a larger bigneſs; theſe two paſſages thus running from the corners of the womb, to the ſtones, are taken only to be certaine liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which the ſtones and the womb are ſtrongly knit together; and theſe ligaments in women, are the ſame things with the Crema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteres in men.</p>

The uſe of the wings, or knobs of fleſh, like Myrtle berries, are for the defence of the internall parts, ſhutting the orifice of the neck, leaſt cold aire, duſt, or any other annoyances, ſhould hurt it, from without; and while they ſwell up, they cauſe titillation and deſire in thoſe parts. Laſtly, the paſſages of the Urine being ſhut up by the knobs of fleſh reſembling myrtle berries, hinders the unvoluntarie paſſage of the Urine.</p>

                  <p>THe action of the neck of the womb, is the ſame with that of the yard; that is to ſay, erection, which is occaſioned divers ways. Firſt, all this paſſage is erected and made ſtreight, for the better conveyance of the yard to the womb. Then while the whole paſſage is erected, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated with ſpirit and vital bloud, whereby it becomes narrower for the more ſtreight em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the yard.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of this erection are, firſt, becauſe if the womb were not erected, the yard could not have a convenient paſſage into the womb; ſecondly, it would hinder convenient affricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which the ſeed could not be drawn forth. Laſtly, it hinders any hurt or damage which might be done by the violent force of the yard.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond uſe is to retain it, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called conception.</p>

                  <p>THe Utilities of theſe veſſels are taken, firſt, from their original, and from their inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the right vein riſing from the hollow, and the left from the emulgent, as in men, that the more hot and purer bloud might come from the right vein, for the procreation of males, and the more ſerous and watry bloud from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgent, for the generation of women.</p>
                  <p>The veſſels alſo in women are ſhorter then in men, becauſe the way is not ſo far to the ſtones; which brevity of the veſſels is lengthened out by the many turnings and windings with which thoſe veſſels are endued. In the middle way thoſe veſſels divide themſelves like a fork, the greater part going to the ſtones, carrying the matter for ſeed; the leſſer is carried to the womb, where it ſcatters it ſelf all along the ſides of it, for the Nutrition of the womb.</p>
                  <p>As for the Arteries, they afford the bloud which is more full of ſpirits to perfect the ſeed.</p>

                  <p>THe uſe of the ſtones in women, is the ſame as in men; that is to ſay, to prepare the ſeed, and to make it fit for procreation. They are ſeated within, that they ſhould not want a continual heat, to cheriſh them; for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſeed being colder in men then in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it requires a greater heat, which it would of neceſſity want, were the ſtones placed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, like thoſe of men; and for that cauſe are they covered only with one tunicle, that the heat of thoſe parts may more eaſily paſs to them. And therefore the ſtones of women, are ſofter then thoſe of men, becauſe they ſhould not perfect ſo ſubſtantial a ſeed; and that the heat of the adjacent parts ſhould not be wholly taken up in the cheriſhing of them.</p>
                  <p>Their figure is not exactly round,<note place="margin">Their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</note> but depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that the little Meanders of the veins diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the membrane, from the ſtones to the deferent veſſels, might have more roome to be inſerted for the attraction of the ſeed, out of the whole ſubſtance of the ſtone. The inequality and ruggedneſs of them makes for the longer ſtay of the ſeed in thoſe crooked and winding veſſels.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Several ſorts of Moles.</note>Of moles there are two ſorts; the one is called the true mole, the other is called the falſe mole. The true mole is a fleſhie body, filled with many veſſels, which have many white, green, or black lines, or membranes; it is without thought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion, without bones, without bowels, or entrailes; receiving its nouriſhment through
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111778:37"/> certaine veines; it lives the life of a plant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any figure or order being engendered in the concavitie of the matrix, adhearing to the ſides of it, but borrowing nothing of its ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Of the falſe mole<note place="margin">Of the falſe mole.</note> there are four ſorts, <hi>the windie mole,</hi> which is a conflux of wind; the watrie mole, which is a conflux of watrie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; the Humorous mole, which is a conflux of various humours; the Membranous mole, which is a thin bag filled with blood. All theſe four are contained in the concavity of the womb.</p>
                  <p>Theſe moles<note place="margin">Sign of moles.</note> are ſomtimes engendered with the Infant, though they do oftentimes cauſe the Infant to die, either becauſe it doth deprive the Infant of that nouriſhment, which goes from the infant to the encreaſe of that, or elſe becauſe it hinders the growth and perfection of the Infant. The cauſe of the fleſhy mole doth not always proceed from the mother, for the man doth often contribute to the encreaſe of it, when the ſeed of the man is weak, imperfect and barren, or though it be good, if there be too ſmall a quantity of it, which after it is mingled with the ſeed of the woman, is chok'd by the menſtrual bloud, and ſo not being ſufficient for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Infant, inſtead thereof produces this little maſs of fleſh, which by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grows bigger, being wrapt about in a caule, while nature ſtrives to engender any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to be idle.</p>
                  <p>It happens alſo when the woman during her
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111778:38"/> monethly purgations receives the company of her husband, her body being not yet purged and void; or elſe when the woman lies with a great deſire and luſt with her husband, after ſhe hath conceived, or when ſhe hath retained her monethly courſes beyond her time.</p>
                  <p>The windy mole,<note place="margin">The windy mole.</note> is engendered by the weak heat of the matrix, and the parts adjoyning, as the liver and the ſpleen, which engender a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of winde, which fix in the concavity of the matrix.</p>
                  <p>The watry Mole,<note place="margin">The watry mole.</note> is engendered of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of water, which the womb receives, either from the ſpeen, or the liver, or the parts adjoyning, or elſe from the weakneſs of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which cannot aſſimulate the bloud which is ſent thither, for the nouriſhment of the thing contained in it; part whereof turns into water, which cannot be voided, but remains in the womb.</p>
                  <p>That which is called the Humorous mole, is engendered of many moiſt humours, ſeroſities, or the whites, or certain watry purgations, which ſweat forth from the menſtruous veins, and are contained in the concavity of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix.</p>
                  <p>The Membranous mole,<note place="margin">The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous mole.</note> is a skin or bag, which is garniſhed with many white and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent veſſels, filled up with bloud: This being caſt into the water, the bloud goes out, and the membrane is ſeen only to gather like a heap of clotted ſeed.</p>

For in falſe conception, the face is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily puffed up, the breaſts, that at the firſt were ſwollen, afterwards become every day more then other ſofter and lanker, and without milk. In fine, the face, the breaſt, the arms, the thighs and groynes grow lank and meager: The belly waxes hard, as happens to thoſe who are troubled with the Dropſie, and almoſt of an equal roundneſs; with many prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains, at the bottom of the belly, which have ſcarce any intermiſſion; which is the cauſe that they can hardly ſleep, being encombered with a heavy and dead burthen. It may be known alſo by other ſigns, for in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception the Male Infant begins to move at the beginning of the third moneth, for the moſt part, and the female at the beginning of the third or fourth moneth, now where any moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on happens, the woman ought to obſerve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe have any milk in her breaſts or no, if ſhe have milk in her breaſts, it is a ſign of true conception, if ſhe have not, it is a ſign of a falſe one. Beſides, in true conception, the mother ſhall perceive her child to move on all ſides, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tner though to the right flank then to the left,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:111778:39"/> ſometimes up, ſometimes down, without any aſſiſtance; but in falſe conception, although there be a kind of motion, which is not enliven'd that proceeds from the expulſive faculty of the mother, and not from the <hi>mole.</hi> The mother ſhall alſo perceive it to tumble always on that ſide ſhe lies, not having any power to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain it ſelf; beſide as ſhe lies on her back, if any one do puſh gently downward the burthen of her belly, ſhe ſhall perceive it to lie and reſt in the place where it was puſhed, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thither: Beſide that which will confirm it more, is, when after the end of nine moneths the woman ſhall not come to her travel, but that her belly ſtill ſwels and is puffed up more and more, all the reſt of the parts of the body growing thin and meager, this is a ſign of a mole, notwithſtanding that many women have been known to go ten or eleven moneths before their delivery.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns of the windy mole are theſe, when the belly is equally ſtretched and ſwelled up like a bladder, more ſoft then when it bears the fleſhie mole, and eſpecially near the groynes, and ſmall of the belly; if it be ſtruck on, it ſounds like a drum; ſometime the ſwelling decreaſes, but by and by it ſwels more and more; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man feels her ſelf more light, it is engendered and encreaſes ſwifter then the fleſhie mole, or the watry, and it makes ſuch a diſſention of the belly, as if one were tearing it a ſunder: For the watery and humorous mole, the ſigns are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111778:39"/> almoſt the ſame; the belly increaſes and ſwels by little and little, as the woman lies upon her back, the ſides of her belly are more ſwelled and diſtended then the middle, or the bottom of the belly, which grows flatter then, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the water and the humours fall down to the ſides of the belly, moving up and down on the belly, as if there were a fluctuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of water there.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction is more to be obſerved in the watry mole, that the flank and thighs are more ſtretched and ſwollen then the humoral, becauſe that the waters flow thither oftentimes, and that which comes forth through natures conduite, is as clear as rock water, without any ill ſavour: but that which flows out in the <hi>humoral</hi> diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is more red, like water wherein fleſh hath been waſhed, and is of an ill ſavour. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be marked in falſe conception, that the flowers never come down, and the navel of the mother advances it ſelf little or nothing, both which happen in true conception.</p>
                  <p>There are beſides theſe above written, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other tumours which the women do take for moles. Theſe occaſion a rotundity and ſwelling in the belly, which are not diſcovered till the woman be opened, and then there doth appear, though the body of the womb be clean and neat, without any thing contained in it, at one or both corners of the womb, a quantity of water, contained as it were in little bags; in others are to be ſeen a heap of kernels and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111778:40"/> fleſh cluſtered up together in the womb, which cauſe it to ſwell. Yet in theſe women it hath been obſerved, that their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations have been very regular, which hath been a ſign that the womb it ſelf hath been in good temper.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another excreſcency of fleſh, which may be termed a pendent mole,<note place="margin">The pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent mole.</note> which is a piece of fleſh, hanging within the inner neck of the womb, which at the place where it is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened, is about a fingers breadth, ſtill increaſing bigger and bigger toward the bottom like a little bell: This fleſh hanging in the interior neck of the womb, poſſeſſes the whole orifice of the privy member, ſometimes appearing outward, as big as the fiſt, as hath been obſerved in ſome women. Of the cures of all theſe we ſhall treat in due place.</p>

                  <p>IN the firſt place ſhe ought to chuſe a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and wholſome air, neither too hot nor too cold, nor in a watry and damp place, nor too ſubject to fogs or winds, eſpecially the South winde, which is a great enemy to women with childe, cauſing oft times abortion in them. The North winde is alſo hurtful, engendring Rhumes and Catarrhs and Coughs, which do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111778:40"/> force a woman to lie down before her time. Likewiſe the winds which carry with them evil odours and vapours, for theſe being ſucked with the air into the Lungs, are the cauſe of divers diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>For her diet<note place="margin">Her Diet.</note> ſhe ought to chuſe meat that breeds good and wholſome nouriſhment, and which breeds good juice, ſuch are meats that are mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately drie, the quantity ought to be ſufficient, both for themſelves, and for their children, and therefore they are to faſt as little as may be, for abſtinence unleſs upon good occaſion renders the child ſickly, and tender, and conſtrains it to be born before its time, to ſeek for nouriſhment, as the over-much diet ſtuffs it up, or renders it ſo big, that it can hardly keep its place.</p>
                  <p>All meats too cold, too hot, and too moiſt, are to be avoided, as alſo the uſe of ſalads and ſpiced meats; and the too much uſe of ſalt meats, are alſo forbidden, which will make the childe to be born without nails, a ſign of ſhort life. Her bread ought to be good wheat, well baked and levened. Her meats ought to be Pigeons, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Pheſants, Larks, Partrige, Veal, and Mutton. For herbs ſhe may uſe Lettice, Endive, Bugloſs, and Burrage, abſtaining from raw Salads: for her laſt courſe ſhe may be permitted to eat Pears, Marmalad, as alſo Cherries and Damſons; ſhe muſt avoid all meats that are diuretick, and provoke urine, or the termes, and ſuch meats as are windy, as Peaſe, and Beans.<note place="margin">Of Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Yet becauſe there are ſome women that have ſuch depraved
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111778:41"/> ſtomachs, by reaſon of a certain ſalt and ſower humor contained in the membranes of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, as that they will eat coles, chalke, aſhes, cinders, and ſuch like traſh, ſo that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to hinder them; to ſuch therefore we can only ſay thus much, that they ought to forbear as much as in them lies, aſſuring them that ſuch traſh does not only endanger their own health, but the health of the childe. Yet if they cannot command that depraved appetite, let them ſo provide, though it be by giving ſome ſmall ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to their depraved longings, that they do not haſten any further inconvenience; for though thoſe ſtrange meats be very contrary to nature, yet the ſtrange deſire that they have to them, does not a little avail to the diſgeſtion of them. For her drink, let it be ſmall Ale, though now and then a cup of pure wine does not amiſs, to comfort the ſtomach and the parts dedicated to generation.</p>
                  <p>Her time of ſleep<note place="margin">Her ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> is beſt in the night, for the concoction of thoſe meates which ſhe hath eate in the day time: ſhe muſt avoid, by all meanes, the ſleeping after dinner; ſhe may ſleep full out nine houres; her ſleeping beyond that time is prejudiciall.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt four moneths ſhe ought not to lye with her husband, for that ſhakes and moves the fruite of her womb, and cauſes the flowers to deſcend; ſhe muſt alſo abſtain in the ſixth and eight; but in the ſeventh and ninth it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, and is thought to facilitate the delivery.</p>
                  <p>She ought alſo to keep her body ſoluble, which if it ſhould come of it ſelf, ſhe muſt take looſing ſyrups to help nature; Aſſoon as ever they perceive themſelves to be with child, they muſt lay a ſide their busks, and not ſtraighten themſelves any way, for feare of hurting the fruit of their womb, by not giving it its full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of growth.</p>

                  <p>Now of the next matter of the birth, there is a difference among the learned, which being unneceſſary for this place, we ſhall let go, and ſtick cloſe to them, who affirm, that the ſeeds of both ſexes, being confuſed in the womb, doth make up the firſt matter of the birth; ſo that if there were not a mixture of both ſeeds, it were impoſſible that any generation could be. Yet though there be of neceſſity a confuſion of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:111778:44"/> both ſeeds, we deny not but that their qualities are different, for the ſeed of a man, exceeds the ſeed of a woman, both in thickneſs and heat, which is more cold and moiſt, and therefore more watry. Yet though they differ thus in quality, it is not to be denied, but that the ſeed of the woman, gives a mutual aſſiſtance to the ſeed of man, in the work of generation.</p>
                  <p>But it being unqueſtionable, that the menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud is the matter of the womans ſeed, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ye may know the original of it, it is to be underſtood, that the Menſtruous blood,<note place="margin">Of the monſtruous bloud.</note> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſ but an excrement of the third concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gathered together every moneth, and purged out: Which purgation being duly made, the woman is then in perfect health of body; but if they come not down according to their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed times, and ſeaſons, or do not come down at all, the woman neither can conceive, nor engender.</p>

                  <p>But of the ſuperfluous moiſture of theſe two tunicles, are begot two other tunicles, which defend the infant from being cloged with any ſuperfluities, as from the flowers retained, after conception, which ſerve neither for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor for the increaſe of the infant. Yet are they retained till the very time of the birth, at which time they are either let out, by the hand of the Midwife, or elſe burſting the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, wherein they are contained, they flow out of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond tunicle is that which was ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Allancoides, wrapping about all the inferior parts, from the navel downward; this is full of folds and wrinkles; in which the urine, ſweat, and other ſharp humours, that diſtill from the infant, almoſt grown to maturity, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and kept to the time of delivery.</p>

                  <p>AFter the womb hath received the Genital ſeed, and by its heat hath ſhut them both up, curdled and coagulated together, from the firſt to the ſeventh day are generated many fibres, bred by a hot motion, in which not long after, the liver, with its chief Organs, is firſt formed. Through which Organs, the vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit being ſent to the ſeed, within the tenth day forms, and diſtinguiſhes the chiefeſt members. This ſpirit is let in through certain veins of the ſecondine, through which the bloud flows in and out, of which the navel is generated. At the ſame time, in the clotted ſeed there do appear three white lumps, not unlike curdled milk, out of which ariſe the liver, the brain and the heart.</p>
                  <p>Preſently after this, a vein is directed through
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:111778:46"/> the navel, to ſuck the thicker ſort of the bloud that remains in the ſeed, for the nouriſhment of the parts. This vein is two forked.</p>
                  <p>In the other branch of this vein is a certain bloud collected, out of which the liver is firſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;<note place="margin">The Liver framed.</note> for the liver is nothing but a certain maſs of bloud, or bloud coagulated and hardened to a ſubſtance: and here you may ſee what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of veines it hath, which ſerve both for the expulſive, and attractive faculty. In the other branch are generated thoſe textures of veins, with a dilatation of other veins, as alſo of the ſpleen and the guts in the lower part of the belly; by and by all the veins, like branches gathering into one trunk, toward the upper part of the liver, meet all in the concave or hollow vein. This trunk ſends other bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of veines, to conſtitute the Diaphragma, others it ſends into the upper part of the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, ſeated about the Diaphragma, as alſo the lower parts, as far as the thighs.</p>

But in the concavity of the left part of the heart, ariſes a great beating vein, called the Aorta, diffuſing the vital ſpirit from the heart into all the beating veines in the body.</p>
                  <p>Under the ſaid vein, called the Aorta, in the concavity of the heart, there is another vein, called the veiny Artery, which was therefore fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to carry the cool air from the Lungs, to temper the great heat of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Now there being many veins, which running from the concavity of the heart, are inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lungs, therefore by theſe veins the Lungs are alſo framed; for the vein which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the right concavity, produces a moſt ſubtile bloud, which is turned into the ſubſtance of the Lungs. By the great veins of the heart and liver, the <hi>hollow vein,</hi> and the Aorta is the whole breaſt generated, and after that the arms and legs in order.</p>
                  <p>Within the foreſaid time, is generated the laſt and chiefeſt part of this ſubſtance, that is to ſay, the brain, in the third little skin of this maſs, for the whole maſs of the ſeed being repleat with vital ſpirits, that vital ſpirit contracts great
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:111778:47"/> part of the Genital moiſture into one certain hollowneſs, where the brain is formed; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it is covered with a certain covering, which being baked and dried by the heat, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a bone, and ſo is the Cranium made.</p>
                  <p>Now the brain is ſo formed as to conceive, retain, and change the natures of all the vital ſpirits, whence are the beginnings of reaſon, and of all the ſences; for as out of the liver ariſe the veins, out of the heart ariſe the arteries, ſo out of the brain ariſe the nerves of a more ſoft and gentle nature, yet not hollow like veins, but ſolid. Theſe are the chiefeſt inſtruments of all the ſences, and by which all the motions of the ſences are made by the vital ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>After the nerves, is generated by the brain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the pith of the back-bone, which cannot be called marrow: for the marrow is a ſuperfluous ſubſtance begot out of the bloud, deſtined for the moiſtening, and for the ſtrenghthening of the bones: but the brain and pith of the back-bone take their beginning from the ſeed, being not deſtined for the nouriſhing or ſtrengthening of the members, but to conſtitute certain private and particular parts of the body, for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſe of the ſences, that all the other nerves may take their beginning thence; for from the pith of the back-bone, do ariſe many nerves, by which the body obtaines both ſence and motion.</p>
                  <p>Here is alſo to be noted, that out of the ſeed it ſelf are generated griſtles, bones, tunicles, for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:111778:47"/> the veins of the liver, the arteries of the heart, the brain with its nerves; beſides the tunicles and pannicles, and the other coverings which the infant is wrapt in. Now of the proper bloud of the birth, the fleſh is formed; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever parts are of a fleſhie ſubſtance; as the heart, the liver, and the lights. Then are all theſe nouriſhed by the menſtruous bloud, which is attracted through the veins of the navel. This is all diſtinctly done from the conception unto the eighteenth day of the firſt moneth, in all which time it is called ſeed. After which it receives the name of Birth.</p>

                  <p>VVHile the birth remaines in the womb, it is cheriſhed up with blood, attracted through the navel, which is the reaſon that the flowers doe ceaſe alwayes in women, as ſoone as they have conceived.</p>
                  <p>Now this blood, preſently after conception, is diſtinguiſhed into three parts; the pureſt part of it is drawn by the child for the nouriſhment of its ſelfe; the ſecond, which is leſs pure and thin, the womb forces upwards to the breaſt, where it is turned into Milke.</p>
                  <p>The third and moſt impure part of the blood
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:111778:48"/> remaines in the matrix, and comes away with the ſecondines, both in the birth, and after the Birth.</p>
                  <p>Now the infant being thus formed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the womb, for the firſt moneth ſends forth its Urine through the paſſages of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; but in the laſt month, that paſſage being ſhut up, through the privie members; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, while the Infant is in the womb, he voyds nothing out at the fundament, becauſe he hath taken no nouriſhment in at the mouth. After the fourty fifth day it receives life, and is then called an Infant.</p>
                  <p>Now though the infant hath by this time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſence, yet doth he not move: He moſt commonly moves in twice the time that he was formed, and in thrice the ſpace after he began his motion, he haſtens into the world; as for example, if the Infant were formed in forty five dayes, it will move in ninetie, and be born the ninth month after that, and thus much of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and nouriſhment of the child in the womb.</p>

                  <p>AFter the third and fourth moneth, the infant is nouriſhed with more plenty of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until the time of deliverie approach. Now you muſt obſerve that a childe born in the ſixth month, cannot live, by reaſon that it is not come to its juſt perfection; but if it be born in the ſeventh moneth it will very eaſily live, becauſe it is come to its full perfection. Now the reaſon why thoſe that are born in the eight moneth. doe not live, when as thoſe which are born in the ſeventh doe, is plaine; for in the ſeventh moneth, the Infant ſtirs it ſelf, to come forth; ſo that if it have ſo much ſtrength, it eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes its deſire, if not, it remaines in the womb, till it have gathered two months more ſtrength. After this motion of the ſeventh month, if it be not able to come forth, it changes it ſelf into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part of the womb, by which motion, it is ſo weakened, that if it ſhould be born in the eight moneth, it were impoſſible that it ſhould live, for it is weakened by a double motion, not only that of the ſeventh moneth, but alſo by that motion whereby it ſtrives to go forth in the eight moneth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the ſcituation of the child in the womb, it may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either generally, or ſpecially; ſpecially, either as it concerns the male, or the female.</p>
                  <p>The male is commonly ſcituated in the right ſide of the womb, the female in the left.</p>
                  <p>The general ſituation of the childe, either male or female, in the womb, is always the ſame. Which hath been obſerved and ſeen to be in this poſture, when the infant lies with his back and his buttocks, leaning againſt the back of the mother, the head enclined, and touching his breaſt with his chin; reſting his two hands upon his knees, his navel and his noſe between his two knees, with his two eyes upon his two thumbs; his legs folded backward, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his buttocks with each leg.</p>
                  <p>This figure is the moſt natural, as being leaſt ſubject to ſuffer any accident, being leſs incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:111778:49"/> and leſs troubleſome to the mother.</p>
                  <p>The moſt naturall form for the childe to come into the world, is when the head comes forward, the hands being ſtretched upon the hips.</p>
                  <p>The things which are the cauſes of a womans delivery, are three; firſt, the want of reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and air, for the infant. The ſecond is the want of nouriſhment, of which when the infant finds a defect in his mothers womb, he is forced to ſeek it in another place. The third is the narrowneſs of the place where the infant lies, ſo that he is forced to ſeek room other-where, which makes him to break the membranes wherein he was contained, preſſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the mother by the ſharpneſs of thoſe waters, to do her duty for his releaſe. Now as ſome ſay, there are three ways or manners of childrens comming upon the earth; firſt, when the head comes foremoſt, and then the woman is eaſily delivered; the ſecond, when it comes forth a croſs, or one ſide, or the feet foremoſt, and then the woman ſuffers much, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they both dye, or one of them. As for thoſe births which are unnatural, we ſhall in another place treat of them, and their remedies. In this combate, the infant and the mother ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer very much, by reaſon that woman is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture delicate and timorous, and not patient, of much labour; or becauſe that women great with childe live a lazy and ſloathful life; and beſides that, many times they eat bad victuals, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe humours &amp; ſuperfluous excrements, which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:111778:50"/> quantity of humours makes the woman to breath ſhort, which is a thing very troubleſome to the infant; for a woman that will expel the birth quickly, ought to keep her breath in, as much as ſhe can.</p>
                  <p>The third reaſon of the pain in womens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, is by reaſon that the head of a childe is bigger, being compared to the members, then the head of any other creature, which makes a greater opening and dilaceration.</p>
                  <p>But the women that ſuffer moſt pain, are they who were not delivered before, having not been accuſtomed to the ſufferance of that labour; as alſo elderly women, by reaſon that the <hi>bone</hi> of the <hi>pubes,</hi> the <hi>bone of the hip,</hi> and the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> are not ſo eaſily ſeparated, the ligaments being more ſtrong and hard.</p>
                  <p>Now in the contention which the child makes to iſſue forth, the head comes firſt, by reaſon of the weight, being more heavy then the other members.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Her Bed.</note>She ought to prepare a little bed, or couch, of a moderate hight, as well for the convenience of the midwife, as for the eaſe of herſelf, and others that ſhall be about her to aſſiſt her in

                  <p>When ſhe findes her pains growing,<note place="margin">In the time of travail what to do.</note> it will be neceſſary for her to walke leiſurely up and down the chamber, afterwards ſhe may lie downe warme, and then riſe and walke againe, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the coming down of her waters, and the opening of the womb. For to keep herſelfe long a bed, is very troubleſome. Though when ſhe is a bedd, notwithſtanding that ſhe hath ſome certaine paines ſomtimes, yet ſhe may lie and reſt herſelfe, and now and then take a nap. By which meanes, both the mother and the Infant doe with greater ſtrength endure their ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardſhip; beſides that, her waters do come downe better. If her travel be long, ſhe may take ſome broth or the yolk of a poched egg, with ſome bread, or a cup of wine, or diſtilled water; yet ſhe muſt have a care left ſhe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg her ſelf, either with meat or drink.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, that all women are not delivered alike; for ſome lie in their bed, others ſit in a chair, being ſupported and held up by others, or elſe reſting upon the ſide of the bed, or chair; others upon their knees, being upheld under their arms; but the beſt, and ſafeſt, is to lie in their beds; and for her good and convenient delivery, let the Midwife, and others, obſerve what follows.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Certain Rules.</note>Firſt, the woman that is in travail, ought to be laid upon her back, her head being lifted up a little higher, with a pillow, having alſo a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low under her reins to ſuſtain her back; under her buttocks and <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> ſhe muſt have a larger pillow, to raiſe them a little, and that her rump may be elevated; for a woman that lies low in thoſe parts, can never be well delivered for the avoiding of which, this ſcituation is very convenient. Her thighs and knees muſt be a good way ſeparated the one from the other, with her legs bowed and drawn up toward her buttocks, the ſoles of her feet, and her heels, being fixed upon a boord, laid thwart the bed for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſome women they doe uſe a ſwath-band, four double, this ſwath-band muſt be a foot broad, or more; which being put under her reines, is to be held up ſtreight, by two perſons ſtanding on each ſide, juſt at the time of her paines; both of them, at the ſame inſtant, heaving up both ends, with an exact cavenneſs; for otherwiſe, it does more harme then good. It is alſo requiſite, that two of her freinds ſhould hold the upper part of her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that ſhe may be able to force out the birth with more advantage; And it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, for ſome of her friends to preſs the upper parts of her belly, ſo to thruſt downe the infant, by little and a little, ſuch a ſoft compreſſion, will much facilitate the travel and give eaſe to the womans paines.</p>

                  <p>For her eaſe therefore, the woman ought to take theſe remedies; two ounces of oyle of ſweet Almonds, with an ounce of Cinnamon-water, or elſe ſome wind diſpelling Glyſter, and if the firſt time ſuffice not, you may reiterate it; ſometimes fomentations, that are proper for the diſpelling of winde, are very neceſſary for this purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>VVHen the woman begins to cry out, and hath ſent for her Midwife, the firſt thing that the Midwife is to ask, is, when ſhe did conceive? 2. Then is ſhe to look diligently upon the belly of the woman, and to mark it well, for if ſhe do behold the upper parts of the belly ſunk and hollow, and the lower parts of the belly full and big, ſhe may then conclude that the child is fallen down. 3. She ought then to ask her ſome queſtions concerning her pains; for if they be quick and ſtrong, beginning at the reins, and ſliding down all along the belly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ending at the navel, but ſtill falling down upon the groins, and inwardly at the bottom of the belly, below which is the interiour neck of the womb, theſe are certain ſigns that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man begins to be in labour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But for more certaintie, the midwife may put up her hand, being anointed firſt with freſh butter, and if ſhe perceive the interior neck of the womb to dilate it ſelfe, tis a certaine ſigne that the paines of childbed are upon the woman, or if ſhe perceive any thing to puſh forwards, her travaile is alſo undoubtable.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the falling down of the waters, a good while before the woman travails.</head>
                  <p>There are ſome women, who have their waters come from them, a long time before their travaile, ſometimes twelve days, ſometimes eight dayes, ſomtimes ſix, and ſometimes foure; though the ordinary time be not aboue three houres before her travaile: they remaining for the moſt part not above twenty four howers. This is cauſed by ſome ruptures of the membranes, where from the beginning of the formation of the child, the humour is contained, rather then by the abundance of humours; and therefore though a woman that hath abundance, and that the membranes containing them, are ſo ſtrong that they wil not breake ſuddaine, though the woman ſhall not travail till they breake, yet the midwife ought not to break them, but rather hold the woman over a veſſel of warme water, and alſo uſe ſome ſoftening linniment, to ſoften the membranes, that ſo the mother ſtraining the head or other member of the child, may breake them more eaſily.</p>
                  <p>But for thoſe women that have theſe eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations ſo long before they travaile, they muſt refraine going into the aire, for feare of injuring themſelves, the paſſages being open;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:111778:54"/> for though the air cannot hinder the childe from coming forth, by reaſon of its weight, yet oft times getting within the ſecondine, it not onely ſtreightens the veſſels, and mouthes of the veines, that are at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the womb, but alſo cauſes ſeveral convulſions, to the great danger of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but it is an eaſie thing to remedy theſe accidents, by keeping cloſe in her chamber, having alſo a ſpecial regard to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, whether they be the waters of the birth, or any Hydropick humour of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix.</p>

                  <p>THe Midwife ſeeing the birth come na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, the pains now coming thicker and thicker, the womb alſo opening to be delivered of its burthen, and the endeavours of the childe being ſeen to come forth; The Midwife muſt now encourage her pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, admoniſhing her to ſhut her mouth, and to hold her breath, and to ſtrein and endeavour with her lower parts; Neither ought the Midwife be too haſty, either to widen or force the paſſage of the Infant, or to break the membranes, but to ſtay till
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:111778:54"/> the membranes do burſt of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>

                  <p>When the head comes forth of the womb, the Midwife muſt take it gently between her two hands, and then when the pains increaſe, ſlipping down her hands under the arm-holes, gently drawing forth the Infant, yet ſtaying her hand always, but when the pains come upon the woman. This muſt be done with a very delicate and tender hand, leſt the child, by any rude or harſh handling, ſhould receive any deformed ſhape of body.</p>
                  <p>When the child is come into the world, which is commonly with his face downward, it muſt be ſuddenly turned upon his back, leſt it ſhould be ſtifled for want of air. Then let her cut the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-ſtring, leaving the length of four fingers, tying it with a ſilk thread, as near the belly as may be: Which done, the childe if it be well, may be laid aſide, only care muſt be had, that the head and the ſtomach be well covered, and that nothing come upon his face.</p>

This happens to women that are not well purged after their deliverie; for remedie hereof, having put the matrix right into its place, roule up two linen ſwathes, pretty hard, bringing them alſo round the hipps; then take whites of eggs, beaten, and a dram of Pepper in pouder, which being ſpread upon Toe, is to be applyed warme to the navil; then let the bellie be well ſwathed; this is the only remedy to eaſe the paine.</p>

To remedie this, the woman ought to take often a ſmall quantitie of wine, in a ſpoon, and if the weakneſs be much, let her mix half a dramme of Alkermes, with a draught of wine, and take care that ſhe be well ſwathed upward; for that preſſes downe and ſtreightens the veſſels, and hinders the violent flux: give her alſo the yolke of an egg to take, for that recalls the natural heat to the ſtomach, which was diſperſed through the whole. It would be neceſſary alſo, to ſpread a long the reines of the woman, and all along the back-bone, by reaſon of the hollow veine, a napkin dipt in Oxicrat, or water mingled with vinigre.

                  <p>After this ſwath the woman with a napkin about a quarter of a yard large, having before chafed the belly with oyl of St John's wort.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:111778:60"/> a feaver, keeps another from it; and therfore women in Childbed are to be governed by their ſeveral conſtitutions. As for women that are delicate, and have been accuſtomed to live delicately, greater care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them, giving them meats that breed good nouriſhment, and do not clog the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, forbearing alſo to give her thoſe meats to which ſhe has too great a diſlike, agreeing to her humour, provided that the meats which ſhe loves be not hurtful, and giving her for the firſt eight days of her lying in, boyled meats rather then roſted, as gellies, &amp;c. the juyce of Veal or Capon, but not mutton, it being too feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, giving her to drink barly water, or elſe water boyled, wherein is boyled a dram of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon to every pint, and two ounces of ſugar diſſolved, or if ſhe do not love ſugar, Corian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeed water, if ſhe drink wine, let it be two thirds of water to one third of wine, giving her in the morning White wine, and in the afternoon Claret, taking care of eating any thing that may breed any crudities, ſhe may alſo take at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of thoſe about her, Almond milk now and then. There are ſome women that cannot be kept from ſleeping, and others that cannot ſleep at all. It will not be amiſs to give to thoſe that cannot ſleep, French barly water; the way to make it well, is to let it boyl well, and to take the broth without ſtreining it; neither ought it to be taken after the eight dayes are paſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it nouriſhes exceedingly, and does not a little obſtruct the Liver.</p>

                  <p>This being done, and the Mother fully delivered, you muſt tie the Navel Veine with a ſilk well twiſted, and many times doubled, and if there be any blood in the veine, you muſt be ſure to emptie it, for feare if it ſhould be left, it ſhould turne into corruption; then it muſt be well dryed with pouder of rotten wood: you muſt tye it, two fingers breadth from the belly, and leave it long, three fingers breadths above the tying place, and if it be fatt, you muſt cloſe it over and aboue, that the veine may be well cloſed, then wind the ſtring twice about it, knitting as many knots; but if the child be come a fore its time, you need not tye it ſo ſtrong for feare of cutting it with the ſilke; but if the Navel veine be full of water and wind, you ought then, having tyed it one time and wrapt a linnen cloth about the end of it, which is ſtill to be held upward, to uncover it againe, about half an hour after, and then to tye it and wrap it about againe, ſtill keeping the end up for feare, that if the veine were not fully cloſed, that there might be ſome danger in the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Some people give to the Infant Treacle diſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olved in wine; but this muſt be don warily in a very ſmall quantitie, and that not commonly neither.</p>
                  <p>The Infant muſt be waſhed with water and wine luke warm, to clenſe it; After wards waſh the face, as alſo chafe the throate, the Armes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:111778:63"/> and hands, with oyle of wallnuts, drawn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fire, which ſome ſay will keep them from ſunburning, then put one hand upon the bone of the forehead, and another upon the bone called the Coronal bone, and ſoftly cloſe up the gap which was made during the time of travaile, cloſing alſo the ſuture one againſt another exactly; then gently put your finger under the tongue, to ſee if the Infant have the ſtring or no; and if it have, it may be clipt away with the poynt of a paire of ſharp cizers, without danger There are ſome that thinke they can ſhape the head and noſe of a child as if it were of wax. But let ſuch take notice that have flat noſed Children, rather to let the noſe alone, then by ſqueezing and cloſing it too much, to render the noſe obſtructed; for that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing the Griſtles of the noſe renders the child liable either to ſpeake alway in the noſe, or to loſe his ſmelling, There are ſome children that are borne with their noſes awry, for the help of which you may with your finger moyſtened in fair water, gently ſtroke the noſe, but lay no ſtreſs upon it. That happens by reaſon that the noſe of the child lights upon ſome bone of the Mother as it was comming into the world.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> How a woman lying in of her firſt child, may avoid the gripings of her belly.</head>
                  <p>THere are ſome women lying in of their firſt childe, who are troubled much with gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings in the belly, and theſe women commonly endure pains when their terms come down, by reaſon of the ſmalneſs of the veins which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh the bloud into the Matrix; ſuch women have griping in their bellies when they lie in of their firſt child, which other women are not troubled with, by reaſon that they have larger veſſels; yet although they have them not in their firſt lying in, it would not be amiſs to uſe ſome proper remedies, that ſo they may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubled with them, which if they receive not at their firſt lying in, they will be uncapable of receiving them ever after, for though they may take remedies afterwards to leſſen the pain, yet they can never cure it wholly.</p>
                  <p>Now that which is ordinarily done to women is as ſoon as ever they are brought to bed, is to give them two ounces of oyl of ſweet Almonds drawn without fire, with two ounces of ſyrrup of Maiden-hair; tis true this is good to make her purgations part away, but not to remedy the gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:111778:65"/>
                  <p>Some there are that do take two drops of the bloud which comes out of the navel-ſtring of the Infant, and give it mingled to the woman in the foreſaid ſyrrups, though there is much fault to be found with this by reaſon of the naſtineſs of it.</p>
                  <p>Others do boyl a white Chicken, in the which they do put two ounces of Sugar, a dram of fine Cinamon, half a Nutmeg grated, two or three Dates, five or ſix Cloves, the Fowl being boyled, you may put into it a ſmall quantity of Claret, then boyl it altogether again, letting it boyl till the Fowl be well ſoaked, then ſtrain it, and give it to the woman as ſoon as ſhe is laid down; for want of a white Hen you may take a Pigeon, or a red Partridg for want of either; Onely take heed to give her this if ſhe be feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, becauſe it is ſomething hot.</p>
                  <p>The ſeed of Savory taken in warm broth is very good, and it is alſo very good for thoſe that have the collick.</p>

                  <p>BEing now come to talke of the impediments of the birth, you muſt know that the birth is hindered by a twofold manner, the one natural, the other not natural; of the unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral we ſhall treat of in its place; for the natural take theſe following directions: But in the firſt place let the Midwife be very skilful, that ſhe may decline as much as in her lies, all the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that may be avoided.</p>
                  <p>If the birth be hindred by the drineſs and ſtraightneſs of the neck of the womb, take a little beaten Hellebore or Pepper, and blow it into the noſtrils of the mother. Her mouth muſt be held cloſe, her breath kept in, and ſneeſing muſt be provoked as much as may be, whereby the ſpirits being forced to the lower parts, may be the more available to force down the childe. You may alſo give her Shepherds-purſe dried in a little broth or wine; alſo a little quantity of hony mingled with twice as much luke-warm water and give her, will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. The milk alſo of another woman mixt with maiden-hair, and applied warm to the navel. She may take alſo oyl of Laurel in wine or warm broth, two grains of Pepper being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:111778:66"/> inwardly do not only force out the birth, but alſo drive out the ſecondines.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo an excellent remedy againſt a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult travail.</p>
                  <p>Take Trochiſchs of Myrrh one dram, grains of Saffron ten, Cinnamon one ſcruple, mingle all this with two ounces of Peny-royal water, and give it the woman to drink.</p>
                  <p>Let her drink it warm, and let her go to her bed for an hour, till ſhe finds the operation of the drink moving her to her labours. If this profit, and that the Infant coming with his head foremoſt ſtick in the womb, you may uſe theſe pills, of which ſhe may take ſeven and then reſt.</p>
                  <p>℞ Gum, Bdelium, Myrrh, Savin-ſeed, Liquid Storax, or Stacte Caſtor, Agaric, of each half a ſcruple, Diagridium ſix grains, mingle all theſe with Caſſia extracted, as much as ſuffices, and make up pils about the bigneſs of peaſe.</p>
                  <p>You may alſo uſe a peſſary, as long and as thick as your finger, of pure wool, which muſt be covered over with ſilk, and dipt in the juice of Rue, where Scammony hath been diſſolved, and ſo uſed. If theſe things prove without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhe may uſe this enſuing bath above her belly.</p>
                  <p>Take of the roote and herb Althea ſix hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls, Mallows, Camomile, Melilot, Parſley, of each foure handfulls, Line-ſeed, and ſeed of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreek, of each two pound, Lavender, and Laurel leaves, of each two handfulls.</p>
                  <p>Let all theſe things be boyled to gether in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:111778:66"/> water, where in the woman is to ſit, or elſe to have thoſe parts well wet and moiſtened with ſpunges, which being done, and the woman well dryed with warme cloaths, let her be brought to the bed, and anointed with this oyntment.</p>
                  <p>Take oyle of ſweet Almonds, Hens fatt, Oyle of Lillies, Muſcilage of Althoea, of each halfe an ounce. Mingle all theſe with as much wax as is ſufficient, and make an oyntment: This being done give her this little doſs.</p>
                  <p>Take two yolkes of egges, and boyle them in ould wine, then mix with them theſe ſpices, Cinamon half an ounce, rind of Caſſia two drams, or you may leave out the Caſſia, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof put in the more Cinnamon, ſaffron halfe aſcruple, Savine, Betonie, Venus-haire, Dittanie, Fenugreeke, Lawrel berries, Mint, of each one dram: The bone of the heart of a Hart, Pearles prepared, Mingle all theſe with ſugar, and make a thick pouder and give it.</p>
                  <p>If the ſecondine come before the child, and hinder the egreſs of the child, it is to be cut of, and this following peſſarie to be put up.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> How the ſecondines are to be haſtened out.</head>
                  <p>THe ſecondines afore that the Infant is born, may be many ways hindred; firſt by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie or weaknes of the Matrix, which happens by the frequent motion and endeavouring of the Infant, as alſo by reaſon of the difficultie of the birth, or by reaſon that the womb doth not continue diſtended, or becauſe it is many times ſtreightened, by which the womb is ſo weakned, that by its own force it is not able to expell the ſecondines; Beſides the ſecondines may inwardly ſtick cloſe to the womb, which happens many times through the abundance of ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that are retained in the matrix, by reaſon of which Glutinous humors, the ſecondines ſtick to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:111778:67"/> the Matrix. Theſe are noe way elſe to be pulled away, but by the hand of the midwife. Thirdly, the ſecondines are hard to come away, if all the waters come away with the Infant, for then the ſecondines being left without moiſture, cannot come away by reaſon of the drines of the womb, beſides that the Matrix and the neck of the womb are rougher by reaſon of the drineſs therof. for theſe waters render the way ſlipperie and eaſie both for the infant and for the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, which being ſlipped away, the womb is to be anoynted with juices and oyles. Fourthly, when the mouth of the Matrix, by reaſon of the paines of child-bearing, ſwells, as often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, unleſs there be a provident care taken to prevent it. Fiftly, when the neck, of the Matrix is ſtreighter and more cloſe, and for that reaſon fat women travaile with much more difficultie, Therefore when the ſecondines doe make any extraordinary ſtay, the Midwife is to uſe all her endeavour to make way for them. for that reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cauſes ſuffocation and divers other evils, for being long detained, they putrifie and cauſe an evil ſmell, which aſcending up to the heart, liver, ſtomach, diaphragma, and ſo to the brain, cauſe pains in the head and lungs, ſhortneſs of breath, faintneſs, cold ſweats; ſo that there is great danger, and alſo Apoplexies, and Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, are not a little to be feared. Now in all the time of their ſtay, the women are to be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with convenient food, to add ſtrength to them, giving them ſometimes the yolks of eggs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:111778:68"/> boyled in old wine with Sugar, and ſprinkled over with Saffron and Cinamon, or ſome broth made of Capon or Hen, ſeaſoned with Cinamon and Saffron; It may not be amiſs to make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perfumes for the woman to receive up into her womb, made of Saffron, Caſtor, Myrrh, annd Cinamon, of each the quantity of a bean, and care muſt be had that the fume paſs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Matrix, and this may be done till the fume of theſe ſpices ſhall ceaſe. After this a little ſneezing-pouder is to be put into her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils compoſed of Hellebore or ſuch like, the woman ſhutting her mouth hard, and keeping her breath; If theſe things prevail not, give her this following potion,</p>

                     <hi>j,</hi> ten grains of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, one ſcruple of Cinamon, Peny-royal two ounces; make of this one draught and give her; after ſhe hath taken this and reſted a little while, let a peſſary of Hellebore and Opoponax, wrapt up in pure wool, be thruſt up into the neck of the womb. This will certainly bring down the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, for it is of ſo great vertue, that it is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious in expelling the child which is dead, together with the ſeconds.</p>
                  <p>Take Mallows, Hollihock, Wormwood, Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Calamint, Origanum, an.

                  <p>Neither will it be amiſs to anoint the Matrix with the oyntment called Baſilicon, if this doth nothing avail toward the bringing down of the ſeconds, and that the woman is in great danger of her life, then with the conſent of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and kinred, give her ſeven of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pils, which being taken, let her lie ſtill, till the vertue of them do provoke new pains; for they are of ſo great vertue alſo, that they do expel the dead child, together with the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines; yet herein it will not be amiſs to conſult the skilful Phyſician.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> Of Caſes of Extremity, and firſt, what is to be done to a woman, who in her travail is accompanied with a flux of bloud, and with convulſions.</head>
                  <p>IN the firſt place, great care muſt be had, as to the ſituation of the woman: The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this caſe muſt be laid croſs her bed where ſhe muſt be held by ſome one that hath ſtrength, that ſhe may not ſlide or move her ſelf in the operations of the Chirurgion. Her thighes muſt be held hard and wide abroad, with her leggs bent backwards towards her hipps, and her head leaning upon a bolſter the reines of her back, and her Crupper, being alittle elevated, with certaine pillows put under neath her thighes; beſides this ſhe muſt be well covered with linnen cloaths, laid upon her ſtomacke, belly and thighes, to defend her from the cold and wind: Being thus ſituated, the Chirurgion ought to putt up his hand, being firſt well opened, with in the neck of the womb, to remove all thoſe clotts of blood, which may lie there to obſtruct the paſſages of the blood. He may then trye if the interior neck of the womb be ſufficiently dilated, that he may put in his hand and move the Infant, if it be needfull, which muſt be done as gently and with as little violence as may be, he muſt anoynt it on all parts
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:111778:69"/> with ſweet butter, or good Pomatum, and ſo opening it by little and a little, he may put his hand quite in; and if the waters are not yet come downe, he may without any difficultie let them forth, and then at the ſame inſtant, if the Infant Come with the head forwards, he ſhall gently turn it, to find out the feet and when he hath found one of them, he ſhall gently draw it forth, and immediately tye a riband about it with a knott hanging downe ward, then let him put it in a gaine, ſuffering part of the riband to hang out, that he may more eaſily be able to find out the other foot, which he ſhall quickly doe, by thruſting up his hand a long the thigh of the Infant; when he hath found it he ſhall take the other foot, and draw them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at an even length, giving the woman now and then ſome leiſure to breath; but urging her ſtill to ſtreine her ſelfe when ſhe feeles the paines coming on her, then ſhall the Chirurgion or midwife take a fine linnen cloath, and wrap about the thighs of the child, leaſt by taking it naked, his fingers ſhould ſlip, in that manner drawing it forth, till it appeare all come forth, obſerving ſtill that the belly and the face be ſtill kept downward.</p>
                  <p>Now if the woman have a flux of bloud, and that the neck of the Matrix be open, the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion ought then to conſider, whether the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant or the ſecondine come forth firſt of all, for it oftentimes happens, that the ſecondines paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing toward the mouth of the Matrix, do ſo
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:111778:70"/> ſtop and obſtruct it that they do not give leave for the childe or the waters to come forth, ſo that ſome perceiving that ſoftneſs, are preſently of opinion that the mouth of the womb is not open. But this the Midwife or Chirurgion may eaſily diſcern by thruſting up the middle finger as high as may be, and feeling therewith the circumference of the neck of the womb, by which they wil ſoon perceive whether the womb be dilated or no, and whether it be the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines that preſent themſelves. Now when it is found to be the ſecondines, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily come forth, the Midwife may with her two fingers widen the paſſage, that he may have thereby the liberty to put up his hand, and ſeek for the Infant. Now if the ſecondines are not placed in the middle, they muſt be turned a little, as quickly as may be, that you may more conveniently ſeek for the feet of the Infant, to draw it forth as we have ſaid.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a caſe as this, all care muſt be had that nothing be broken, and that every thing be brought out whole, for ſo though the woman ſhould dye, the Midwife or the Chirurgion would be blameleſs.</p>
                  <p>If the ſecondines come firſt, the beſt way is to deliver the woman withall the expedition that may be, by reaſon of the great fluxes of blood that will follow by reaſon that the veins are opened but here are two things to be conſidered the firſt is whether the ſecondines are much or little come forth; if they are but little advanced,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:111778:70"/> they muſt be put back with care and diligence and if the head of the child appeare firſt it muſt be guided directly toward the neck of the womb; as in the moſt naturall birth, but if there appear any difficulty in the birth, by reaſon of the weakneſs either of the childe or of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the moſt convenient way will be to ſeek for the feet, as we have ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Another thing to be obſerved is, that if the ſecondine be ſo far advanced that they cannot be put back, and that the childe follows it cloſe, then are the ſecondines to be pulled away with all the care and expedition that can be, and to be laid aſide without cutting the entrail that ſticks to them, for by that you may be guided to the Infant, which whether it be alive or dead, it is to be pulled out by the feet with as much care and quickneſs as may be; though it is not to be done but in caſes of great neceſſity, for otherwiſe the ſecondines ought to come laſt.</p>
                  <p>If the childe be dead in the womb of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Of the child dead in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers belly.</note> the woman is then to be ſituated in the ſame poſture, as when ſhe is troubled with a flux of bloud.</p>
                  <p>If it preſent it ſelfe dead, with the head for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and that ther is little or no hope that the woman may be delivered without aſſiſtance, and that her ſtrength begins to faile her, the moſt certaine and ſafe way is to put up the hand, for the Chirurgion muſt then ſlide up his left hand being hollowed, as when a man ſtrives to hold water in it, cauſing it to ſlide in the neck of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:111778:71"/> womb, along the lower part thereof toward the feet, and that betweene the head of the Infant, and the neck of the Matrix, and having thus opened the womb with his left hand, he ſhall with his right put up his hook above his left hand, between the head of the child, and the flat of his hand, and fix it in the bone of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, toward the eare, or elſe in the hollow of the eye, or in the Occipital bone, keeping his left hand ſtill in its place; after this gently mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtirring the head with his left hand, with his right hand holding the hook well fixed, he ſhall draw the child forth by degrees, exhorting the woman all the while to force and ſtreine her ſelfe with all her power; and then is the beſt time to draw forth the child, when the paines ſhall ſeize her; now if it happen that he looſe his hold in one place, the danger is nothing, for he hath the libertie to fix his inſtrument better in another place. The head being thus drawn forth, he muſt with all ſpeed that may be, ſlip his hands down the childs armeholes, to draw forth his ſhoulders, and the reſt of his body: In the meane while it will be requiſite to give the woman a ſmall draught of wine, or a Toſt ſopt in wine or Hipocras.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Another way.</note>If after theſe Medicines following adhibited, the child make no haſt into the world, but lyes unmoved in the womb, then you may proeeed to inſtruments after another manner. Firſt of all, as ſoone as the woman is brought to the bed, let her take this following potion hot, and abſtaine

                  <p>If theſe produce no effect, you may uſe this following Emplaſter.</p>
                  <p>Take Galbanum an ounce and a half, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthis without the grains two drams, the juyces of Rue and Motherwort, new Wax, as much of each as is ſufficient, of each make a plaſter. Let this be ſpread upon a cloth to reach from the navel to the privities, and in breadth to both the ſides, which ſhe may keep on for the ſpace of an hour or two. A peſſary may be alſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,

                  <p>But now if all theſe things avail not, and that the Midwife is not able to dilate the paſſage for the infant, then you muſt have recourſe to the Chirurgion; To which purpoſe ſhe is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a ſeat, ſo that ſhe may turn her crupper as much from the back of the chair as may be, drawing up her legs as cloſe as ſhe can, but ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her hips abroad as much as may be. Or elſe if it ſeem more commodious, ſhe may be laid upon the bed, with her head downwards, with her buttocks raiſed, and her thighs drawn up as much as can be, then you may go to work either with your <hi>ſpeculum matricis,</hi> or his Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſo that the womb being ſufficiently wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the help of theſe inſtruments, the birth may be drawn out by the hands of the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, together with the ſeconds, if poſſible may be. The womb muſt then be waſhed and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the woman then muſt be laid in her bed, and wel comforted with ſpices, as alſo with ſome comfortable meat and drink. This courſe muſt be taken with all dead infants, and alſo with moles and ſecondines, which are hindered in their coming forth naturally.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:111778:72"/>
                  <p>If by theſe Inſtruments the womb cannot be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently widned for the egreſs of the infants, there are yet other Inſtruments, by which the womb may be widened with dammage to the mother, and birth be brought forth, ſuch as are <hi>Drakes bill,</hi> and the <hi>long Pincers,</hi> by which the womb is not only widened, but the birth taken hold of by them for the more forcible drawing it forth.</p>
                  <p>If there be any ſwelling, or inflation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete bloud gathered together in the preputium of the Matrix, under the skin, thoſe tumours either before or after the birth, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appears thinneſt and ripeſt, the midwife may cut with a pen knife and ſqueeze out the matter; anoynting it afterwards often with a peſſary dipt in oyl of roſes until it be whole.</p>
                  <p>If it happen that the child be ſwollen in the womb, in any part of it, by reaſon of wind or any watrie humor, yet if it be alive, ſuch meanes are to be uſed, as may be leaſt to the detriment of the child and of the mother; but if it be dead, in what ever part thoſe humours be, either in the breſt arms or legs, the midwife may then put up her hand, and with a little knife for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, cut the ſwollen, that by letting out of the wind or humour, the child may grow leſs, and be brought forth with leſs difficultie.</p>
                  <p>Many times it happens that the child comes into the world with the feet formoſt; and the hands dilating themſelves from the hipps. In this caſe the midwife ought to be well furniſhed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:111778:73"/> with oyntments, helping the egreſs of the Infant, by anointing and ſtroking it, leaſt it be carried backward. Having alſo a great care to take hold of both the armes of the Infant, and keep them cloſe to the hipps, that the child may come forth after its own manner. If by reaſon of this deduction of the armes, from the ſids of the Infant, and the narrowneſs of the Matrix, it ſo happen that the child cannot make a total egreſs, the womb of the woman, and the Infant it ſelf and child, are to be well anointed, ſneezing powders being adminiſtred to the woman, to helpe her endeavours, the womb is alſo to be preſſed hard with both hands, that the child make no retirement back, but may ſtill move forward.</p>

                  <p>If it happen that in drawing forth the firſt by the feet, that the other chang its ſituation, the midwife may then draw forth the other by the feet, as ſhe did the firſt; and if the head of the firſt be more forward, then muſt ſhe put back the feet of the firſt, and receive that which comes with the head formoſt.</p>

                  <p>If both of them preſs together to the paſſage of the womb, the midwife muſt take great care; and therfore ſhe muſt put up her hand to ſee which of them is moſt forward, as alſo to try whether it be not ſome monſtrous conception, as two heads upon one body, or two bodies joyned in one, either at the ſhoulders, or at the ſides, which may be known, if ſhe put up her hand gently between the two heads as high as ſhe can, and if ſhe find that they are twins, ſhe may gently put the one to one ſide, to make way for the paſſage of the other, which is moſt advanced, which muſt be directed juſt to the orifice of the womb, having a great care that ſhe do not change the ſituation of the ſecond; and as ſhe feeles the pains of the mother coming on her, ſhe muſt by all means bring forward the childe, that ſhe would receive, ſtill keeping the other back, with two or three fingers of the left hand: and thus having delivered the firſt, if the ſecond be not well ſituated, ſhe muſt bring the head to the neck of the womb, where it will find the paſſage open to it, by the delivery of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Now leſt the firſt childe ſhould be in danger of its life, you muſt take it from the mother, and carefully tie up the navel ſtring, as is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, &amp; alſo bind again with a large and long fillet, that part of the navel which is faſt to the ſecondines, that they may be the more eaſily found.

                  <p>If the two Infants have but one body, the better way is to turn the head upwards, and to draw it forth by the feet, then by the head; taking care when you come to the hipps, to draw it forth as quick as may be.</p>

                     <p>There are many cauſes of the relaxation of the Matrix, the one proceeding from great fluxes which fal down upon the ligaments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cauſing them to wax looſe; Others come to this diſeaſe by ſome falls, others by reaſon of carring in their womb too great burdens, others by ſtreining themſelves in travaile before their time, and becauſe the orifice of the womb is not open; ſomtimes, and very often; by reaſon of the midwifes, who putting up their hands into the womb, teare downe they know not what, which is often times apart of the Matrix, to the bottom of which the ſecondines adhere, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down part of the womb. which they take to be the ſecondines, which is often times brought
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:111778:85"/> alſo to a worſe condition, when the unskilfull women force her to the remedies, for bringing down the ſecondines, as holding bayſalt in her hand, ſtreining to vomit, and the like. For remedie wherof, all theſe relaxation of the Matrix, by the ſame remedies, except thoſe which are occaſioned by ſtrong fluxes, for in this caſe other remedies are not ſufficient, being that you are to take away the cauſe of thoſe defluxions, before you can proceed to the cure of the relaxation. Among the reſt I will relate one that hath been found very profitable and experienced, which is this aſtringent. Take Gall nuts, Cypreſs nuts, and Pomegranate flowers, Roche Alum, of each two ounces, Province Roſes four ounces, Centinode, a good big handfull, the rind of Caſſia, the rind of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, Scarlet Graines, of each three ounces, the nature of a whale, one ounce, Myrrh water, roſe water, and ſloe water an ounce and a half, thick wine, and ſmiths water, of each foure ounces and a half; then make two little baggs of a quarter of a yard long, cauſing them to boyle in the foreſaid waters, in a new pot, uſing one after another as you have occaſion, leting it lye upon the bone of the Pubes, paſſing in between the hipps, chafing her often, and holding her head and her reines low, uſing in the morning, ſomtimes a little maſtick, in an eg, or ſomtimes plantaine ſeed: if the diſeaſe be not too old, it may be cured by this meanes, but if it be of a long ſtanding, you muſt make a peſſarie halfe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:111778:86"/> round, and half oval, of great thick cork, peirced through in the middle, tye a little packthred to the end, then cover it over with white wax, that it may doe no hurt, and to make it more thick, this muſt be dipped in oyle of Olives to make it enter, and it muſt be ſtreit that it may not eaſily fall out, and if it be too little, to have an other bigger, &amp; when the woman goes to do her neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary occaſions, ſhe muſt hold it in, leaſt ſhe ſhould force it out; the hole is made that the vapors of the womb may have a vent, and to give way for her purgations to flow, neither muſt it be taken away till after the purgations are paſſed, the thicknes cauſes the matrix to mount up as long, as it is very thick, for the ligaments being cloſe doe then retire. If they be women that beare children, the midwife ought not to ſuffer them to force themſelves, but as nature conſtraines her, having her own hand ready after the throw, to put back the Matrix with her finger, and when ſhe is brought to bed, lay her low with her head and with her reines, raiſing her up, with pillows put under her hipps; and for women that are troubled with this diſeaſe, they ought not to lace themſelves over hard, for that thruſts down the matrix, and makes the woman pouch bellyed, and hinders the Infant form being well ſituated in her body, cauſing her to carrie the child all upon her hipps, and makes her belly as deformed, as her waſt is handſome.</p>

For remedy hereof, you muſt keep the woman ſoluble, giving her Aniſe and Coriander ſeeds to diſſipate the winds.

                     <p>You may alſo prepare the humour to void it out of the place affected, by opening either the middle vein, or the Baſilic, or the Vena Saphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which may be done two or three times, if occaſion ſerve; after bloud-letting, purge, but let this be done with ſweet medicines, ſuch are Caſſia, Manna, Tamarind, ſyrrup of Roſes, or Violets Solutive, having a little before uſed certain ſyrrups, which may aſſwage and temper the humours. Take ſyrrup of Roſes and Purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, of each one ounce, Endive water and Plantain water, of each an ounce, give this to the patient; Neither will it be amiſs to give her ſyrrup of Succory, or Endive, or ſuch like, for theſe ſyrrups have a cooling and refreſhing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, eſpecially being mingled with Plantain, or Endive water, or ſuch like, or the decoction of the ſaid herbs; now when the humour is thus prepared, you may give her ſome gentle purges.

                     <p>Take of the Leaves of Italian Orach three drams, of Aniſeed one ſcruple, infuſe theſe in four ounces of the foreſaid waters. Into this being ſtrained, infuſe an ounce of Caſſia, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:111778:88"/> into the ſtreining of this diſſolve an ounce of ſolutive Roſes; of this make a potion and give it. The fourth way of cure conſiſts in Topicks, ſuch as may drive back and repreſs the humour, though care muſt be had that they be not over ſtrong, leſt you thereby do cool the heart too much, and thereupon drive the humour upon the heart it ſelf. And therefore temperate medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are chiefly to be choſen, and ſuch eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as are able to digeſt and diſſolve the humour: Wherefore it ſhall not be amiſs to apply a linnen cloath dipt in white ſtrong vineger, and a little cold water, which muſt be applied to the breaſts, and often changed. Or elſe you may dip linnen cloaths alſo in a decoction of Camomil flowers, and Violet flowers, with a ſmall quantity of oyl of Roſes, and a drop of vineger or two; or you may uſe this fomentation. Take of the juyce of Nightſhade &amp; oyl of Roſes, of each an ounce and a half, of the decoction of Fenugreek, Camomil and Lineſeed two ounces, vineger one ounce.</p>
                     <p>This medicine you may uſe by dipping a ſpunge therein, and ſo waſhing and fomenting the breaſt therewith.</p>
                     <p>Or you may apply this Cataplaſme; take of the leaves of Nightſhade and Melilot half a handful of each, let them be boyled &amp; extracted through a courſe cloth then add to them bean meal two ounces, Oxymel and oyle of ſweet Almonds of each one ounce; of this make a Cataplaſm and apply it. If the diſeaſe be more prevalent, you muſt uſe more forcible remedies, and among the reſt this fomentation. Take of the leaves of Mallows, Violets, Dill, of each
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:111778:88"/> one handful, flowers of Camomil and Melilot of each a ſmall handful and a halfe, boyl theſe together, adding to them a little wine and oyl of Dill or Muſtard; firſt let the breaſt be fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this, and afterwards with an oyntment compoſed of equal parts of new butter, oyl of violets and Hens fat. But if theſe things avail not to diſſipate the humour, you muſt obſerve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the inflamation tend either to a ſuppuration or induration. If you find that it tends to a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you muſt try all means to hinder it by the way of mollifying plaiſters, among which this is not a little experimented: Take the marrow of a Calves leg two ounces, Sheeps greaſe one ounce, Saffron four ſcruples, Cumminſeed bruiſed, two ſcruples, mingle all theſe and make a plaiſter. If the inflamation doth not harden, but doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together tend to a ſuppuration, which may be known by theſe ſigns; that is to ſay, the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the tumour, the beating and exceſſive heat, &amp; pain which rages about thoſe parts ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, that do not admit them to be touch'd. But now the ſuppuration is to be haſtened with hot and moiſt medicines, which have an Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick faculty, for which purpoſe this is much commended: Take the leaves of Mallows one handful, roots of Althea one ounce, boyl theſe together, and when they are maſhed draw them out, and add to them bean meal and Fenugreek, of each one ounce, the whites of two eggs, myrrh and Aſſa faetida of each one dram, Saffron one ſcruple, mingle all theſe together, and make a Cataplaſm for your uſe; to this you may either add Capons greaſe, Hogs greaſe, or freſh but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="841" facs="tcp:111778:89"/> If theſe remedies do not ſuddenly bring the inflammation to a ſuppuration, you muſt then take of the ſhells of ſnails bruiſed, and lay them upon the Cataplaſm in ſuch a manner, that the ſnail ſhell may come to touch that part of the tumour which is moſt elevated and pointed, whence it appears, that the matter will firſt iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; If theſe remedies avail not, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to open the ſaid Apoſtem, with a Lancet, and this muſt be done when you are ſure that the matter is ready to come forth, which may be known by theſe ſigns, when the beating ceaſes, when the fever, the pain and the heat of the part do begin to diminiſh, when you perceive the place pointed, and raiſed and enclining to a blackiſh colour. When the wound is open, you muſt firſt apply to it a digeſtive, compoſed of an ounce of turpentine, half an ounce of oyl of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the yolk of an egge. After this you muſt cleanſe it with honey of roſes, Turpentine and barly meal, or with the oyntment of the Apoſtles, or the oyntment called Aegyptiacum, then you may put on the top of the place, the oyntment called Baſilicon or Paracelſus plaiſter which doth digeſt, cleanſe carnifie &amp; cicatrize af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a very extraordinary manner. This is further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to be obſerved, that an ulcer in the breaſt is not eaſily cured, if the milk be not dried out of the other breaſt; and therefore the milke is to be dried up by keeping the child from ſucking, and by putting upon the breaſts of the woman, cloaths dipped in cold water, together with bean barly and vineger, and ſuch like reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

               <head>Of windy Tumours in the Breaſts.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He flatuous tumor of the breaſts is cauſed by a thick vapour which riſes from the menſtruall blood which is retained or corrupted in the Matrix. The cauſes of which are, firſt the ſuppreſſion of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; or when the flowers are not diſcharged into their proper place, and in their proper time; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the corruption of the humours by which are ingendred divers bad fumes and vapours; for this being received into the breaſts cauſe a diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much like a true ſwelling. The ſignes by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111778:90"/> which it is known, is the pain w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it brings along with it, which is ſharp and pricking, cauſing a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention of the part. The heart is not a little out of order, by reaſon of the windineſſes which lie ſo neer it: and commonly the left breaſt is moſt ſwoln, communicating its pain to the arm, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ribs of the ſame ſide. And theſe ſignes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thoſe of a Canker; for in this diſtemper the breaſt is white and ſhining by reaſon of the diſtention; and if you touch it, it ſounds like a Drum. And if you preſſe it with your hands, you wil finde that it is ſweld in all parts alike, and not in one more then another. This is cured firſt by a good order of diet, taking little victuals, whereby crudities may be avoided that do afford matter to the obſtructions, and increaſe windineſſe: for which cauſe ſhe muſt alſo drink little, &amp; that, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter boyld with Cinamom, Anis-ſeed, and rinde of Citrons. The next remedy is by uſing things which are good to provoke the courſes, [among which uſe this receit; ſtrein Selandine ſtampt into poſſet-ale, and drink it four dayes before the new moon, and four dayes after.] And it will not be amiſſe to let blood three or four times in the year, about the time that the courſes ought to begin. For by this means you may provoke the flowers, &amp; hinder the increaſe either of a Scirrhus, or of a Canker; to which purpoſe, bathes, frictions, and infections are not a little to be uſed. In the next place, you muſt prepare the humours that foment this windineſſe both in the Matrix, and in the veins, and that by ſyrups which do expell flegme
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111778:90"/> and melancholy: after which you muſt purge your patient; for which purpoſe you may take of the leaves of Sene three ounces, Anis-ſeed one ſcruple; let them boyle in foure ounces of Borage water; vvhen it is ſtreined, infuſe into it Confection Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech vvithout Scammony, Colloquint, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol. Dupl. Rheo. of each an ounce and a halfe; when it is ſtreined, diſſolve in it one ounce of ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive: this potion muſt be given two hours before eating. You may alſo uſe this gentle Apozem: Take of the root of Tamarinds, Cypreſs, Bugloſs, of each an ounce and a halfe, flowers of Borage, Epithymi, Sen. of each halfe a handfull, flowers of Balme one handful, Raiſins one ounce, Prunes in number twelve, boyle them in a ſufficient quantity of vvater: and then in a pint of the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſſolve foure ounces of the ſyrup of Violets; make of this an Apozem clarified according to Art, and ſweeten it vvith a ſufficient quantity of ſugar, giving four or five ounces at a time. In the next place, you may uſe Topicks to attenuate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve; to vvhich purpoſe you may bathe or ſoment the breaſt vvith a ſponge dipt in Lye, and then lay upon it a linen cloth dipt and moiſtned in Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae, and dried in the ſhade; or elſe dipt in freſh butter that hath boyled a good while, or in oyle of Lillies, or in oyle both of the root &amp; ſeed of Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica; or you may foment the breaſt vvith this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction: Take Wheat-bran two handfuls, leaves of Dill and Melilot of each halfe a handfull, Anis-ſeed, Fenell and Cumin-ſeed, of each two drams, Camomill flowers one halfe handfull; boyl
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111778:91"/> all theſe in a ſufficient quantity of water and white wine, and let them boyle to the conſumption of the third part. In this decoction you may wet a ſponge, and waſh or foment the breaſt therewith. After you have fomented the part, you may put this ointment upon the part affected: Take oyle of Lilies &amp; Elder, of each an ounce and a halfe, of the beſt Balſam halfe an ounce, powder of burnt lead unwaſht, Anis-ſeed one dram, and as much Wax as is ſufficient.</p>

                  <head>Of the watry tumour of the Breaſt.</head>
                  <p>THe watry tumour is ingendred by a thick and watry flegme gathered together in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the breaſt and parts adjoyning: and it happens many times that this watry and flegmy ſubſtance is not alwayes gathered to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place, but alſo diffuſed through all the parts of the breaſt, which cauſes a generall ſwelling in that part. This ſwelling (that we may define it) is a looſe and ſoft tumour without much pain, yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the touch and preſſing of the fingers, ſo that the hole which is made by the preſſing of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers remains a pretty while after; yet it ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes painful, if there be any acrimony joyned with it; or if there be any diſtention by reaſon of the preſs of vapours to that part. This often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens by reaſon of the ſuppreſſion of the courſes; ſometimes it is occaſioned by reaſon of a clear and watry flegme which diſcharges it ſelfe upon theſe parts. This ſwelling is eaſily diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111778:91"/> from other ſwellings by reaſon of the looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſoftneſſe thereof, and by the pain which is alwayes leſſe then in other ſwellings: and in this kinde of tumour the pain aſcends up to the arms and ſhoulders, and the whole breaſt is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſwoln and raiſed; and this pain comes at certain times, chiefly when the flowers ought to come down, which being once come down, the pain diminiſhes, by reaſon that the woman is then throughly purged. Yet notwithſtanding there doth remain ſome certain kind of ſwelling, which happens not in the windy tumours, by reaſon that the purgations of the flowers do totally diſſipate the matter of thoſe ſwellings. Theſe flegmy tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours do eaſily turn into Cankers, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be diligently looked after. As to the cure of theſe tumours, there is required firſt an orderly diet, which muſt be drying, her bread muſt bee well baked and leavened, dried Raiſins, parched Almonds, Aſparagus, roſted fleſh, and ſmall birds. Before meat ſhe may take a little hony of Roſes upon a wafer cake. For her drink, let it be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Anis-ſeeds, China root, Saſſafras, and Sarſaparil. If the retention of the flowers be the cauſe of this evill, let her then uſe rather boyled then roſted meats, and then let her boyle them with Sage, Betony and Hyſop. All meats made of milk are dangerous, as alſo ſleep after dinner, and unleavened bread.</p>
                  <p>You may in the next place uſe things to divert the humor, as frictions and baths: if her flowers are ſuppreſſed, let a vein be opened in the feet. Next
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111778:92"/> after you have prepared the humor by the uſe of ſyrups, as thoſe of Mint, Worm-wood, Hyſop, Licoraſs, Maidenhaire, hony of Roſes, with fenel water, water of Hyſop, Marjoram, Roſemary, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Mint, then may you uſe ſome purges with thoſe pils called <hi>Sine quibus,</hi> Agarick pils, and Cochie-pils. If the patient be ſtrong, and not to be worked upon by weak Phyſick, you may then add two or three grains of <hi>Diagridion,</hi> or <hi>Alandaal Trochiſques;</hi> theſe pils are to be uſed for eight days, half a dram at a time. Another way may be by topicks, to attenuate and reſolve: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the fomentations ſpecified in the foregoing chapters may be very fitly uſed, being prepared with Vine aſhes, or figg-tree aſhes, whereto a little Vinegar may be put; though the uſe of things that drive back the humour are not here to be uſed; you may alſo rub and chafe the breſt with this Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; take of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Oyl of Line ſeed, of each one ounce, ganders greaſe of each half an ounce, with a little <hi>Diachylon</hi> inſtead of Wax; a plaiſter of great <hi>Diachylon</hi> would not be amiſs in this Diſeaſe; if the Woman feel any paine or heat in her breaſts, let her anoint them with Oyl of Roſes, a little burnt lead, and a little white wax; or with a little <hi>Oleum Omphacinum,</hi> and oyl of ſweet Almonds tempered together in a mortar. In the diſperſing and reſolving of the humor you may uſe baths of alum and ſulphur prepared with the decoction of Hyſop, Mint, and Sage, and after that ſuch ointments as are moſt approved for the ſame purpoſe, alwaies taking heed of too boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111778:92"/> Remedies: if you would ſuppurate or mature the ſwelling, you muſt uſe ſuch Remedies as we have deſcribed in the following, and fore-going Chapters, the ſtrongeſt of which you may here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, becauſe the matter is more obſtinate and tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, mingling with them for that purpoſe other more effective Remedies, as are the Roots of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, marſh mallows, lillies, figgs, gooſe greaſe, and the like; when the ſore is opened, you muſt tend it after the ſame manner as is before rehearſed There are other Remedies either to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or to be outwardly applied, which ſerve to fortifie and comfort the ſtomack, as to take eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning a ſpoonful of conſerve of Roſemary, preſerved Orange, or trochiſques of <hi>Aromaticum: Roſatum, Diagalanga,</hi> or <hi>diacuminum.</hi>

                  <p>THe kernels of the breaſt are little round bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſoft and thin, like a ſponge, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grow hard by reaſon of the phlegmie humor which is ſometimes purely ſo, and ſometimes is mingled with other ſharp &amp; acrimonious humors But ſometimes it comes to paſſe, that not only the kernels of the breaſt are ſwollen; but alſo that there do grow others which ought not to be there which may not unfitly be termed a kind of the Kings-evil, being a ſwelling which proceeds of thick flegme, or elſe of a thick mattrie blood hardned under the skin; they are cauſed many times by the detention of the flowers, the bloud
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111778:93"/> often times mounting up into the breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The cure of theſe is undertaken two waies; by ſoftning the hard tumor, and preventing the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and then alſo a ſtrict diet is to be obſerved, which muſt be moderately attenuating, &amp; by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves warm, which is performed by moderate exerciſe before meales, as alſo by uſing ſulphury bathes; but ful Diet, eaſe, idleneſs, and meats of hard digeſtion are very dangerous; and indeed in all reſpects beſide, the cure is the ſame as is ſet down in the foregoing Chapter. But if the kernel be ſwelled up with a ſharp humour, thoſe topicks are to be uſed that are preſcribed alſo in the foregoing Chapter: onely in caſe the fluxion remain any time, you may mingle thoſe things which do a little more refreſh; ſuch are oyl of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and oyl of violets. When the flux of humours ceaſes, you may then add oyl of Camomil, and Lillies, and other ſuch like things, to diſſolve and diſſipate the humor.

                  <p>THe Scirrhus of the breaſts is a hard ſwelling without pain: Of this there are two kinds, the one ingendred of a Melancholy, and produced by a feculent and groſſe blood, or elſe from a thick flegme; now this exquiſite Scirrhus is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paine, in which it differs from the other; The other is not ſo exquiſite an hardnes, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not yet come to its ful maturity, or elſe becauſe it hath certain other humours mixt with it. This exquiſite kinde of Scirrhus is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, either becauſe the ſpleen is obſtructed, and cannot purge away the melancholy blood, which for that reaſon abounding in the body diſcharges and empties it ſelf upon the breaſts; or by reaſon of the ſuppreſſion of the courſes, which cauſes the feculent and groſſe humor to diſgorge it ſelf upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111778:94"/> the breaſts, gathering together in the Veins and fleſh of the ſame. Many times the ignorance of the Chirurgion is the cauſe of it, when they apply an unreaſonable company of refrigerating medicines to the inflammations of the breaſt, or too many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving and heating medicines to it in caſe the breaſts be over hard. This Scirrhus is known by its hardneſſe without pain, from the unevenneſſe of the body, and the colour of the part either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to black or brown. Now though the cure of theſe hardneſſes be ſomething difficult, yet is there great hopes that they may be overcome; which is to be done two wayes, by mollifying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently that which is hard, and by taking that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way which remains hard and knotty in the breaſt. And firſt of all care is to be had to keep good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of diet; to which purpoſe ſhe muſt uſe whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bread, reare egges, pullets, capons, partridge, veale and mutton, which muſt be boyled with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, Bugloſs and Borage; ſhe muſt abſtain from Beefe, Veniſon, Hares fleſh and Brawn, from Peaſe and Beans, and unleavened bread, from all ſalt and ſmoked meats; as alſo from all things that have a ſharp biting quality; alſo ſhe muſt abſtain from all care &amp; ſadneſs, immoderate exerciſe and going in the winds. If the monthly courſes be ſtopt, you muſt ſeek to provoke them gently, which may be done by letting blood in the foot, or to let blood with horſ-leeches; in the next place, it will not be amiſſe to purge well with Sene and Rheubarb, to which you may adde Catholicon, or Triphera Perſica, if you find that the diſeaſe needs a more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111778:94"/> ſtrong purgation. Between every purge it will not be amiſſe to take good cordiall and comfortable things, as confection of Alkermes, Triaſantalon, Electuarium de gemmis, conſerve of the roots of Borage, conſerve of Orange flowers. You may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this uſe Topicks, that is to ſay, ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as heat and dry moderatly, being hot in the ſecond degree, and dry in the firſt; ſuch are ſheeps greaſe, eſpecially that greaſie ſubſtance that grows upon the flank of a ſheep, wax, oyle of ſweet Almonds, oyle of Camomil, oyle of Dill, Capons greaſe, Gooſe greaſe, Hogs greaſe, Bears greaſe, &amp;c. Veale marrow, Dears marrow, emulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mallows, Lillies, and other things of more force, as liquid pitch, liquid Storax, Galbanum, Cumin ſeed, Rue ſeed, Broom flowers, and Dill ſeed. If this ſwelling come of a hard flegme, which is known becauſe it yeelds not ſo much to the touch as the other; you muſt uſe the ſame topicks to this, as to the watry tumour before rehearſed. If melancholy be the cauſe of it, you may uſe a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the leaves of Mallows, and Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, of each a handful and a halfe, of Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek and Lineſeed of each two drams, Cucumbers, Bears foot, of each two ounces; boyle them in as much water as is ſufficient, and foment the breaſt with this twice or thrice a day. After that take this ointment: take of the root of Mallows one ounce, when it is boyled and bruiſed, take it out, and add to it ſheeps greaſe, and Capons greaſe, of each two ounces, and with a little Wax make an ointment. This you may uſe for ſome few dayes, after which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111778:95"/> you may, if need require, uſe this ointment: Take Hyſop leaves, Dill leaves, and thyme leaves, of each half a handful, roots of Mallows, and Fenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek ſeed, of each half an ounce, boyl them in as much wine and vinegar as is ſufficient, til halfe be boyld away; then take of the aforeſaid vinegar, Gooſe greaſe, Ducks greaſe, and the marrow of the leg of a Hart, of each two ounces, boyl it to the conſumption of half the vinegar; you may add to this two drams of Diachylon, and make it into the form of a plaiſter: You may alſo uſe for this purpoſe plaiſters of Melilot, or Oxycroceum.

The ulcer it ſelf is very unequal, the lips &amp; orifice thereof being ſweld with hardneſs, and inverted; a light fever poſſeſſeth the body, and often ſwoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And many times the peſtilencie of the humor having corroded a vein, there iſſues out a great deal of blood. If the canker be ulcerated, or in any inward part of the body, no medicine can prevail; for remedies do more exaſperate then help it. To burn it with iron is peſtilent; and if it be cut with a penknife, it returns again as ſoon as it is but skind over. But if it be an exulcerated canker, (which is eaſily known, &amp; ariſes from a more ſharp matter, for then the fleſh is corrupted, ſending forth a very noyſom mattier, being very irkſom to the ſight, and accompanied with a gentle Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſwooning, and iſſuing out of blood;) The cure of this is to be done by drying &amp; refrigerating medicines, or by inciſion to the quick, &amp; expreſſion of the corrupted blood afterwards; after which the wound muſt be wel cleanſed; for which purpoſe the powder which is called <hi>Hartmans bleſſed powder,</hi> is very prevalent.

                  <p>THe defect of milk ariſes from a double cauſe; for either it is a defect in the blood, which is dried up by reaſon of ſome hot maladies of the body, either through intemperancie of the Liver through faſting, or too much evacuation. If the deficiency of milk come from theſe cauſes, it may be increaſed again either by prepared chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal; the leaves alſo, root and ſeed of Fenel do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail much in this particular, and the powder of Earth-worms prepared and drunk in Wine, as alſo the Electuary called <hi>Electuarium Zacuthi.</hi> There is another cauſe which proceeds from the Lactify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality, which is many times ſo weak, that it can neither attract nor concoct the blood, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome outward refrigerating and aſtringent qualities, or by reaſon of ſome other diſeaſes. The cure of which being looked after in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective places, much conduceth to the reſtoring of that defect. The redundance of blood proceeds from too great a plenty of blood, and a ſtrong la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying quality. In the cure of which the increaſe of blood is to be impeded, which is done by dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up that humor, and diverſion; to which blood-letting conduceth much: Medicines alſo that drive it back are to be put upon the breaſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the arms; to which purpoſe Hemlock boyld in Chervile water and vinegar, avails.</p>
                  <p>Curdling of the milk is, when the thinner part
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111778:97"/> of the milk exhales, and the more groſſe and heavy part ſtayes behinde, which many times is the cauſe of tumors, kernels, and Apoſtems. In this caſe the infant is not to ſuck the part affected; though that breaſt is alſo to be ſuckt, for fear leſt the milk which is newly generated ſhould be curdled and knotted by that which is there already, and ſo that part of the coagulated milk may be hindered from putrifying. To the diſſolving of the milk it much conduceth to waſh the breaſt with water, wine and vinegar mixt together, as alſo a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation made of the decoction of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, Fenugreek, and melilote, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing them with a liniment of Oyl of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, juice of Parſley, and Vinegar, wherein let the gall of a Hare be firſt diſſolved.

                  <p>THis narrowneſs is either of the Womb it ſelf, or of the orifice of the Womb; the ſignes are the ſtoppage of the Courſes, followed with a depreſſing and weighty paine. The cauſe is partly natural from the nativity, and partly varies according to the differences of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: the difference is in this, it hapning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that this ſtreightneſs conſiſts in the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior orifice, whereby neither the flowers have free paſſage, neither can ſhe enjoy coition, or conceive with child, becauſe ſhe cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive either the man or the ſeed. Sometimes the narrowneſs is in the interior orifice of the Womb, into which the flowing retires back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to the abſolute hindrance of conception; ſometimes it is occaſioned by way of compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when the Caul being fatter then ordinary lies upon the neck of the Womb.

The humour is next to be provoked forth, and a Tent dipt in ſome ſuppurating plaiſter is to be put up; the next day it is to be waſhed with water and honey, and cicatrizing plaiſters to be applied; if it come after the birth, it is either occaſioned by an ulcer, and then either the ſides of the neck cling together, in which caſe either inciſion or cauterization is to be uſed, or elſe there is a brawnie ſubſtance which is to be cut away with a penknife; or elſe ſome ſpungie &amp; luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant fleſh, in which caſe drying and diſcuſſing Medecines are to be uſed, as Birthwort Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, Myrrh, and Maſtick; afterwards you may apply things to eat it away; and laſt of all to cut it away by inciſion.</p>

The cauſe of this are certain cholerick, ſharp and aduſt humors, and thick, which falling upon theſe moiſt and looſe places do there eaſily make their way. The cure depends upon the conſideration of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111778:99"/> cauſes: Among the preparing Medecines ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Fumitory is much commended, and Cichorie with a decoction of Lupines. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks alſo are uſeful that diſcuſs and mitigate the humor, as baths, and inſeſſions, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the place with wine and Nitre, which is often to be uſed.

                     <hi>Condylomas</hi> are certaine ſwelling wrinkles in the neck of the Womb, with pain and heat. There is no need to tel the ſignes of theſe, for they are apparent to the eye; the wrinkles are like thoſe which appear in the hand when you cloſe the fiſt; but are much bigger when the courſes flow: they are cauſed by aduſt and thick humors; ſome of theſe are with an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which have more paine and heat, and the ſwelling is hard: In the cure of which you muſt uſe inſeſſions, and fomentations that eaſe paine; ſometimes they come without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which if they be new come are to be dryed up; if they be old, they are firſt to be ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, afterwards to be digeſted and dryed up; for which purpoſe you may uſe powder of Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels burnt, or this Ointment: Take of the

                  <p>Take whites of four Eggs, beat them wel, and put to them an equal quantity of Roſewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Plantain-water as much in quantity as they come to, Camphire, Ceruſe, Litharge of gold, and Bole Armoniack, of each a little quantity, green Copperas half as much as of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, beat all to powder, mix it, and ſtrein it through a cloth, and make your injection til the part affected be whole; and if there be any paine, ſometimes inject a little new warm milk.</p>
                  <p>Others are more gentle, with a little ſtinking mattier flowing from them. For the cure of which gentle abſterſives are profitable, as hony of Roſes with Barly-water, whey with ſugar,

                  <p>There is another diſtemper of the womb which is dry, which is diſcerned by the want of ſeed, and the defect of the courſes, by ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to venery, drineſſe of the mouth of the womb, by a blackiſh colour of the lower lip, which is alwayes chapt. It ſometimes ariſes from the very nativity, which cauſes a dry and lean conſtitution of body; ſometimes through age, and then women ceaſe to bring children; ſometimes from inflammations, and ſuch like diſeaſes; ſometimes from a defect of blood which ought to moiſten the parts; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens either through a narrowneſſe and obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the veins, or elſe becauſe it being
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111778:103"/> voided out at the neck of the womb cannot pierce to the bottom. The cure of this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed firſt by a contrary diet, where you muſt alſo avoid much labour, watching, hunger, and ſadneſſe. Secondly, by the uſe of moiſtning things, amongſt which are moſt commended Borage, Bugloſs, Mercury, Mallows, Violets. Among outward means, Bathes of ſweet water, and unctions with oyle of ſweet Almonds, oyle of white Lillies, Hens-greaſe, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Calves legs. The cure is the more hard, if the drineſs have been of any long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
                  <p>There is another which is a compound di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, which is moſt often cold and moiſt, which is diſcerned by comparing the ſignes of the ſimple diſtemperatures together. It ariſes from flegmie humors: The cure is performed by preparing the matter with hot things, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation of the matter with ſuch Medecines as are moſt proper to purge flegme: as alſo by a particular pargation of the Womb it ſelf; to which purpoſe peſſaries do very much conduce; as alſo ſulphury and drying baths; as alſo the uſe of ſudorificks, or things that provoke ſweat may be very profitable, as the decoctions of <hi>Lignum ſanctum, China, Sarſaparilla,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick wood.</p>

                  <p>THe ſignes of the narrowneſs of the veſſels of the Womb, are partly the retention of the flowers ſo that they cannot flow, as alſo the hindrance of conception, by reaſon that the paſſage of the blood is intercepted.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes are partly external, as from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent baths, and Medecines, which is known from the relation of the party affected; it is cured more eaſily by moiſtning and mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicines.</p>
                  <p>The other cauſes are internal, as from fleſh or membrane, clinging to the orifices of the womb, or by a cloſing up of the orifices of the veins by reaſon of ſome violent extraction of the ſecondines, which is commonly incurable; the only cure which may be tryed is by molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying applications. Another cauſe is deduced from obſtruction, which ariſes from certain thick viſcous and copious humors flowing from other parts of the body, the heat of thoſe places not being able to attenuate them, or elſe gather together in the womb it ſelf by reaſon of the weakneſs of the heat of that part: it is diſcerned by the ſame ſigns as the cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, there being alſo a ſlimy matter which now and then comes down from the womb: It is cured as other obſtructions, by ſharp and bitter Medicines, and ſteel wine, as alſo baths made
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111778:104"/> with opening and mollifying things.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes this narrowneſs ariſes from a compreſſion of the parts, occaſioned either by ſome ſwelling, or Scirrhus, either within or without the womb; if this be, there do appear manifeſt ſignes of ſwelling: it is an evil for the moſt part incurable; many times it is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by an over fatneſs of thoſe parts, which is plain to the ſenſe.</p>

                  <head>Of the puffing up of the Womb.</head>
                  <p>THe puffing up of the Womb is a windy ſwelling of that part, occaſioned from a cold, flegmie, and flatulent matter, which is increaſed through the defect of natural heat in the Womb: This is called the windy mole, it giving hopes of a conception. The ſignes of this are a diſtention of the womb not far from the midriff, which is now increaſed, now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; ſometimes extending it ſelf to the navel, ſometimes to the loyns, and Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. It differs from the Dropſie, partly becauſe the ſwelling is not ſo great, and the party affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted is not much troubled with thirſt, by the increaſing and diminiſhing of the tumor; and by the upper parts, not being ſo lean.</p>
                  <p>It is diſtinguiſhed from the Dropſie of the womb by the fore-apprehenſion of the cauſes that beget thoſe windy vapours, by the ſound and leſs ponderoſity, as alſo by a feeling of an extenſive and pricking pain in the womb,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111778:105"/> and parts adjoyning. It is alſo diſtinguiſhed from an inflation of the inteſtines, becauſe here is no great pain, neither is the Patient hard bound, yet the Flowers are ſuppreſſed, and the feet and hollow of the eyes do ſwel, and the colour of the body is changed, the woman draws her breath ſhort, and is ſad, and when ſhe awakes is fain to lift up her head to take breath. It differs from a mole, becauſe there is not that heavineſs and ponderoſity in the womb; beſides, the woman doth not feel the burden of her womb tumble from one ſide to the other: It is diſtinguiſhed from conception, by the ſound, and by the increaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of the ſwelling, and by the deadneſs of the motion, not like that of a dead infant: For if the Midriffe be violently compreſſed, the winde being then compelled to the part adjoyning, there is a kinde of palpitating mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perceived through all the Midriff.</p>
                  <p>The matter of this diſtemper is generated either in the womb it ſelf, or by reaſon of the ſuppreſſion of the courſes, or by the intercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of due purgation after delivery. Many times it comes through the veins and ſeminal veſſels. Now the weakneſſe of the heat proceeds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the external aire, ſometimes from hard delivery, from the ſuppreſſion of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from abortion, &amp;c. The cure is performed after the ſame way that other cures are reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died: among thoſe things that purge, <hi>Species Hierae,</hi> and <hi>Diaphaenicon,</hi> with <hi>Caſtor,</hi> are moſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111778:105"/> commended; for Fumes, Nutmeg is counted the beſt; for potions, Nutmegs bruiſed and boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the roots of Mather, and drunk in ſix ounces of wine, and two drams of ſugar. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this winde gets into the cavity of the womb, and then the neck and orifice of the womb is cloſed, ſo that nothing can go forth, when the woman is moved, or when the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe is preſſed down with her hand, and then a kinde of noyſe and ſound is perceived. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the winde gets into the tunicles of the womb, and then the mouth of the womb may be open; by reaſon of the ſhutting up of the windy vapours in a narrow place, there goes a noyſe forth, and the pain grows greater, and extends farther. This is more hard and difficult to be cured then that which is in the concavity of the womb.</p>

                  <p>The ſignes are various; There is a ſwelling in the womb with heat and pain, and a retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the womb to the more inward parts; the neck of the womb appears red, with little veins ſcattered up and down in it, like the web of a ſpider. There is ſometimes a difficulty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111778:106"/> of breathing, with ſome kinde of pleuriſie, becauſe the interior tunicle of the womb being extended, which riſes from and is joyned to the Peritoneum, the parts alſo to which that coheres, are ſtretched.

                  <p>The cauſe of this conſiſts in the blood, which is ſometimes mixed with choler, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with melancholy.</p>

If it be an <hi>Eriſypelas,</hi> or <hi>St. Anthonies</hi> fire, there is no cure at all, becauſe the Birth dies by reaſon of the exceſſive heat which cauſes abortion to follow, which kils the woman; if it turn to a gangreen, it is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: it is cured as other inflammations, which may be obſerved in the following Chapters.

                  <p>Theſe inflammations ſometimes affect the whole womb, and ſometimes either ſide of the womb, which cauſes the heat to deſcend into the hip, becauſe of the ligaments of the womb which are carried thither; the thigh is difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved, and the groins are inflamed; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the inflammation poſſeſſeth the poſterior part, which cauſes the Belly to be bound, and a pain in the loines, and back bone; ſometimes it poſſeſſeth the forepart, which becauſe it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the Bladder, the urine is ſuppreſſed, or made very difficultly; and the paine is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111778:107"/> being opened more then ordinary, or becauſe the Womb is not able to receive, or to retaine its wonted proportion of blood: it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Mole, becauſe in that diſtemper the Flowers, if they flow, flow inordinately; the breaſts ſwel with milk, which in the Scirrhus grow very lank.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this is a groſs feculent humor, being a thick blood, ſometimes Flegmy, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Melancholy, which happens to thoſe who decline in their age; or to thoſe who have been troubled with a ſqueamiſhand naught ſtomach often it ariſes from an ill cured inflammation, through the uſe of medecines that cool too much.</p>
                  <p>The cure is difficult, either becauſe having been dryed for a long time they cannot be ſoftned, or becauſe the natural heat in thoſe places where the Scirrhus is, is for the moſt part extinct; and then becauſe while the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is mollifying, if it have conceived any putrefaction, it eaſily turns to the Canker: for the cure, it is the ſame as of the Breaſts.</p>

                  <p>THe Dropſie of the womb is a diſtemper from water collected in the womb, either by ſome fault in the part it ſelf, or in the parts adjoyning. The ſignes of this are a looſe ſwelling at the bottom of the Belly, extending it ſelf according to the proportion of the womb; the fewneſs and naughtineſs of the Courſes; a moiſtneſs, and ſlenderneſs of the neck of the womb, ſoftneſs of the Breaſt, want of Milk, a ſhivering in the body, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Fever: It differs from an inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the ſymptoms above related; and from an inflation, in the defect of ſound and diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; from a Mole, becauſe in this there is a greater weight perceived at the bottom of the Belly, and the Breaſts at the time of delivery are not without Milk. It differs from Conception, becauſe in the Dropſie the ſwelling is juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form of the womb; but in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception it is alwaies ſharper. In women with Child the flowers do not flow; but in this diſeaſe there flows ſuch a certain bloody viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humor, without any order, which ceaſes quickly. It differs from the Dropſie of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the face of the Patient is coloured, unleſs the liver be any way affected, the want of thirſt, and the aſcent of the ſwelling from the lower part to the upper.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:111778:108"/>
                  <p>The cauſe of this is a water gathered there through ſome defect of the Liver or Spleen, or through ſome weakneſſe in the vvomb; by reaſon whereof it is not able to concoct or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the excrements; or through a too immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate defluxion of the courſes, which oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the naturall heat; or through a ſuppreſſion of them, which ſuffocates the heat.</p>
                  <p>The cure is to be performed by the educti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the water, and ſtrengthening of the womb; for which purpoſe the uſe of Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial pils is not a little to be commended. Her diet muſt be of meats that breed good juice; ſhe muſt drink little; ſhe may uſe in ſtead of drink a Ptiſane or Barly-broth, made with ſaſſafras, or ſalſaparil; if her courſes be ſtopt, you may let her blood in the foot: if the reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be great, then to let her blood in the arm wil not be amiſſe. Some have commended the decoction of the root of <hi>Fugere,</hi> to take at meals, and between meals, without any other drink.

                  <p>THe falling of the womb is the falling of it down below the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> or Midriffe, proceeding from a looſneſſe of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>The generall ſignes of this are, a pain in the loyns and hairy parts, and of the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> or holy bone, to which the womb is faſtned; at the beginning the pain is not very great, nor after long continuance, by reaſon of uſe: the weight thereof being onely troubleſom, which is an impediment to the patient in going; the particular ſignes do vary, according as the tall is greater or leſſe: for in the one the womb deſcends to the middle of the Hips, and lower; in the latter there is perceived the diſtention of the skin, and as it were the weight of a good big Egg about the privities.</p>
                  <p>The cure of this is difficult, if there be the greater falling of the womb, if the woman be in age, if a Fever, Convulſion, or other ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms happen; if that be in women with child, it is deadly; and ſometimes it is corrupted by the ambient aire, and turns into a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene. The cure conſiſts in the reputting of it into its own place; where you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve firſt, to ſtop the inflammation, if there be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111778:109"/> any; or if there be any ſwelling cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the cold aire, you muſt foment the part firſt with the decoction of Mallows, Marſh Mallows, flowers of Camomill, and Laurel-berries. If there be any winde or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement in the gut, you muſt uſe Clyſters firſt; it is alſo to be fomented and anointed with agglutinating and aſtringent or binding me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decines; there is a Fumigation to be made of the skin of a ſalt Eele dried and powdered. When it is to be put into its place, the woman muſt be laid with her belly upwards; then muſt the Midwife, or other party imployed, with a linen cloth dipt in oyle of Roſes a litle war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, gently thruſt up the part which is fallen, as gently as may be, turning it a little. Now to keep it up, the woman muſt be kept lying on her back, with her thighs ſtretched out, and one laid upon another acroſſe; the belly muſt not be too much bound, leſt in the ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the excrement the womb ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain precipitated; neither muſt it be looſe, leſt the membranes binding the womb ſhould be unlooſed: then muſt you uſe agglutinating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decines, Peſſaries, Fomentations, and Inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yet great care muſt be had leſt you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the courſes. Of this there be ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, either by reaſon of the looſneſſe of the Ligaments which are foure, which is diſcerned in that it is generated by degrees, and with leſſe pain: It ariſes either from hard labour, or a ponderoſity or heavineſſe of the childe,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111778:110"/> or from the concourſe of flegmie humors; it is cured by the evacuation of humours, and by the uſe of aſtringent and corroborating Medecines; ſuch as are the decoction of muſk of the Oak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Harts-horn, Laurel leaves, and the Aſtringent plaiſter.</p>
                  <p>Another cauſe and difference ariſeth from the rupture of the Ligaments; which is diſcerned by this, that the evil comes ſuddenly, and is more painful, and is ſometimes followed with a flux of Blood; it ariſes from the heavineſs of the Birth, or from a difficult labour, or from Abortion, or a difficult and violent extraction of the ſecundines.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes this happens from an intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie of the womb, which if it be cold, the womb is not able to concoct ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nouriſhment, and therefore heaps up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether many excrements; if it be moiſt, it is not able to contain either the blood, or the ſeed, or the birth, as it ſhould do. The cure of this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove touched in the chapter of Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>There is another difference which is taken from the occult qualities which the womb is ſeen to have, there being a ſympathy and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy between that and divers things, as to covet the ſeed of man, and to love ſweet things; and then the affection ariſes from no evident cauſe, there being no exceſſe of coldneſſe or moiſture to be apprehended. The medecines which are to be applied for the cure of this, muſt be proper in their whole ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the difference ariſeth in this, that the naturall heat is either ſuffocated or diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this affection is ſomething dangerous, becauſe it is a difficult matter to reſtore the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat. In the cure of this reſtoratives muſt be notwithſtanding uſed; ſuch are Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom, Nutmeg, <hi>Species diaxyloaloes Aromaticum Roſatum.</hi>

                  <head>Of the pain of the womb.</head>
                  <p>THere is no need to give other ſignes of this then the complaint of the woman; it affects women that are both free, and women
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111778:111"/> that are with childe: It happens ſometimes from corroding humours, eſpecially cauſed by ulcers or vitious flowers. The cure whereof is referred to theſe heads; ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from a diſtention cauſed either by ſome curdled blood ſticking in the cavity of the womb, and then there is a copious flux of blood out of the womb, and the pain is fixed chiefly about the orifice of the womb; the right gut and the bladder being affected by reaſon of the continuall deſire of expelling forth the humor. In the cure, firſt you muſt ſeek to diſſolve the clotted blood, which is done by the uſe of Treacle diſſolved in wine; and then to evacuation, which is performed with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garic,</hi> Aloes, with the juice of Savine, deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Roſemary, with the flowers of Cheiri, in wine. Sometimes it is cauſed by the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous blood, when the veſſels are more open, or the blood too thick; which happens through the overmuch uſe of cold drink, eſpecially when the woman is hot. The cure may be found in the cure of the ſuppreſſion of the flowers. Sometimes it is cauſed by other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humours collected in the concavity of the womb, or adhering to the other veſſels; &amp; then theſe humours are to be removed with purging and evacuating medecines. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times windy vapours are the cauſe hereof, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the heat of the vitious humours cauſed by copulation. It is cured by things that diſcuſſe the winde; to which purpoſe it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111778:112"/> may not be amiſſe to uſe a Clyſter made of Malmeſey and oyle of Nuts, of each three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of Aquavitae one ounce, of oyle of Juniper and diſtild Rue, of each two drams, &amp; applied warm; or a mixture of ſpirit of wine, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nitre, of each half a dram, or two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, exhibited in ſpirit of wine; Sperma Coeti, with oyle of ſweet Almonds, or a plaiſter of Caranna and Tachamahacca applied to the navel.

                  <head>Of the ſuppreſſion of the Flowers.</head>
                  <p>THe ſuppreſſion of the Flowers is the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the menſtrual blood, either by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the narrowneſs of the veſſels, or through ſome corruption of the blood. The ſignes are evident from the relation of the woman; yet if they are loath to confeſſe, it may be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this; For in virgins the ſuppreſſed blood wanders up and down the veins, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets obſtructions, changing the colour of the body, and cauſing Fevers. In women, becauſe the blood is carried down to the womb, where it begets many diſeaſes; it is diſtinguiſhed from retention after conception, becauſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with child find no alteration of affections of the minde, and retain the native colour of their bodies; and in the third moneth they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111778:112"/> ſhal perceive the motion and ſituation of the Infant; and laſtly, the mouth of the Womb is cloſed up.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of this diſtemper are the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the veins, and the vitiouſneſs of the blood. The cure of this muſt be haſtened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſuppreſſion if it ſtay long begets many more diſeaſes, as Fevers, Dropſies, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of blood, and the like; the cure is hard if it be of any continuance, and if it ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſixt moneth, it is almoſt incurable; eſpecially if it happen through any perverſion of the neck of the womb; for then the Woman is troubled with often ſwooning, and vomiting of blood, and a paine ſeizes the parts of the Belly, the back, and the back-bone, which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Fever, and the excrements of the Belly and bladder are ſuppreſſed; a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs poſſeſſes the whole body, becauſe of the diffuſion of the retained blood through the whole body, and eſpecially the hips and thighs, becauſe of the ſympathy of thoſe parts with the veins of the womb. In the firſt place, the letting of blood is commended; for the blood which every moneth ſtaies in the body, &amp; ſticks in the veins, is to be provoked downward to the womb; and therefore a vein is to be opened in the heel, for ſo the plenty of blood is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the motion of the blood is made toward the womb; if neceſſity requires that it ſhould be done more then once, one day a vein muſt be opened in one thigh, and another day
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111778:113"/> in the other; and that which is opened for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation muſt be firſt opened, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the hamm or heel, muſt be done after purgation, 3 or 4 or five dayes before the time that the accuſtomed evacuations of the Woman ought to come down. Cupping-glaſſes alſo are to be applyed firſt to the more remote pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to the thighs; and then to the neerer parts, as to the hips, ligatures or bindings and frictions, at the time of the coming down of the flowers, after purgation of the whole Body, are not to be omitted. In the ſecond place the matter is to be prepared, for which purpoſe, in bodies troubled with flegme, the decoction of <hi>Guaiacum,</hi> with <hi>Cretan Dittany,</hi> doth much avail without provoking ſweat. In the third place evacuation is to be made at ſeveral times. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong evacuating Medecines are commended <hi>Agaric,</hi> Aloes, with the juice of <hi>Sabina,</hi> and theſe pil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the fourth-place, by an obſtructing the humour by thoſe things which provoke the flowers; of which theſe are moſt to be commended, the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Roſemary with flowers of Cheiri, Peny-royal water twice diſtilled, and mingled with Cinamom water; Extract of Zedoar, Angelica,

                  </p>
                  <p>The differences of this diſeaſe ariſe, partly from the obſtruction of the veins of the womb, cauſed by a cold and thick blood, and thick ſlimy humors mixed with the blood, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming either from ſome hot diſtemper of the womb, which diſſipates the ſharp and ſubtile hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and leaves behinde the groſs and earthy parts; or from the cold conſtitution of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſpleen; eſpecially if at the time of the menſtrual flux (at what time the flux of blood is more violent) thoſe ſubtile humors happen to be diſſipated, &amp; then at the time of the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purgation the party affected feeleth a great pain in the loyns, and parts adjoyning; and if any thing come down, it is ſlimy whitiſh and blackiſh: the whole Body is poſſeſſed with a numneſs, the colour pale, a ſlow pulſe, and raw urines. The cure is the ſame with the former, great care being taken of a groſs and ill dyet.</p>
                  <p>There is another difference of this diſeaſe when it happens by compreſſion, which ariſes from external cauſes, as the Northern wind, and long ſtanding in cold water, which may be knwn from the relation of the ſick perſon.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111778:114"/> The blood in this caſe is to be drawn to the lower parts by Frictions and Baths; or from internal cauſes, as fatnes, or ſwelling of the womb, or of the lower parts; in which caſe Medecines muſt be applyed that aſſwage the ſwelling. There is another difference which is in the hardneſs of the skin, which happens ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the firſt nativity, and then the diſeaſe is not eaſily taken away; or long after from ſome cold &amp; dry diſtemper: concerning which look the former Chapters.</p>
                  <p>Another difference there is, when there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a cloſing up of the skin, which is cauſed after cicatriſing of an Ulcer, or by reaſon of ſome skin or membrane growing to the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the womb: or by reaſon of frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion; after which theſe veins to which the ſecundines adhere, do grow together ſo cloſe that they cannot be afterwards opened.</p>
                  <p>Another difference of this diſeaſe there is, when it happens through want of blood, which is not generated either by reaſon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſes, as famine, over much evacuation, iſſues, and ſuch like; or through internal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as a frigid conſtitution of the principall parts, old age, and fevers; or when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to other uſes, as before full growth to the nouriſhment of the body: in women with child, to the nouriſhment of the birth: in thoſe that give ſuck, to the increaſe of milk: and in fat people, to the augmentation of the fat: or when it is conſumed either by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111778:114"/> cauſes, as overmuch exerciſe, affrights, terrors, ſadneſſe, bathes, overmuch ſweating, which do conſume the ſerous quality of the blood: or through internall cauſes, as are hot and dry diſeaſes, or over great evacuations in other parts of the body. Sometimes another difference of this diſeaſe proceeds from the dryneſſe of the blood, which happens to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who in the winter time do too much heat their lower parts, by putting coals under their coats. For the cure thereof you muſt uſe refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating and moiſtning medecines.</p>

                  <p>THe dropping of the flowers is, when they are coming down for many dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drop by drop.</p>
                  <p>This happens both from externall cauſes, as over-hard labour, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And ſometimes from the droſſineſſe of the blood, the paſſage not being wide enough. For the cure of this, it is convenient to open a vein in the arm, with gentle purging, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes from the weakneſſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive faculty, there being at that time great plenty, thinneſſe and ſeroſity of the blood. In this caſe there is no pain; Medecines that binde and corroborate the ſtomack here muſt have place.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:111778:115"/>
                  <p>The difficulty of the Flowers is when they come down with pain and trouble, either through defect in the veins, or in the blood. The ſignes of this are gathered from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſick perſon, who is then much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with pain in the head, ſtomack and loyns, and lower parts of the body. And they do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flow altogether, or drop by drop, as in the former diſeaſe: it is a diſeaſe more incident to maids then married women, becauſe the veins of the womb are leſſe open in them then in thoſe who have brought forth children.</p>
                  <p>It happens ſometimes from a corruption of the blood, that is, from the droſſineſs and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, and then the blood clots toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and there is great pain long before the flowers begin to come down. The cure of this is performed by attenuating medecines. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the ſharpneſſe and acrimony of the blood, which proceeds from a mixture of ſharp humours with the body, and then the genital parts do itch. It is cured by thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decines that temper the ſharpneſſe of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as the four greater ſeeds, violets, and flowers of Nenuphar. Sometimes from windy vapours, and then the pain comes by intervals, and is ſuddenly exaſperated, rumbling up and down; and when the wind is forth the pain ceaſeth. The cure hereof is procured by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the matter, and diſpelling of the wind, as is before declared.</p>

                  <head>Of the diſcolouring of the Flowers.</head>
                  <p>THe diſcolouring of the Flowers is when their right colour, which ought to be red, declines either to paleneſſe, whiteneſſe, green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yellowneſſe, or blewiſhneſſe, through ſome defect or vitiouſneſſe of the blood.</p>
                  <p>The ſignes are apparent by the ſight of the blood; beſides that it is accompanied with an ill ſmell; many times alſo it is the cauſe of Fevers, trembling of the body, loathing of the meat, pain in the ſtomack, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The differences of this diſeaſe conſiſt firſt in the vitiouſneſſe of the blood, which is cauſed through ſome diſtemper either of the whole body, or of ſome part thereof. Sometimes the blood is affected by reaſon of ſome ſtoppage thereof, and then the flowers are ſuppreſſed, which cauſeth pains in the breaſt, and ſtrong beating of the breaſt; and if the woman begin to amend, the blood flowes out with a ſtinking putrefaction, which continues till the eighth day; or it may be, becauſe the blood is fould by the womb, being full of excrements; and then you may perceive the ſignes of a foul womb.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the difference of this diſeaſe conſiſts in the mixture of the blood with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vitious humours. The cure conſiſts in preparation and evacuation; but care muſt be had, that becauſe the thick humours need at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111778:116"/> and that over-attenuating things, do melt the ſerous humour, that you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not uſe over-attenuating things, as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Another difference is, when the flowers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to a whitiſh colour, which proceeds from abundance of flegme, or from putrefaction, and then ulcers follow in the womb, &amp; barrenneſs follows; unleſſe the womans flowers do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to flow for ſeven or eight dayes together, by which the woman is freed from the diſeaſe; or elſe they break out to the parts above the groyn, without any tumour, and burſt forth a little above the Hypochondrion, and then the woman ſeldom lives: or elſe there wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after ſome few dayes a great ſwelling in the groyn, without a head of a red colour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fleſh is there filled up with the blood.</p>
                  <p>When it inclines to yellowneſſe or green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the diſtemper comes of choler; when to a blackneſſe and blewneſſe, from melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>

                  <head>Of the inordinate flux of the Flowers.</head>
                  <p>THe diſorderly flux of the courſes is either the coming of them down before their time, or elſe the ſtoppage of them for ſome time after the uſuall courſe of nature. They come down ſometimes before their time, partly by reaſon of internall cauſes, and partly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111778:116"/> by reaſon of external cauſes, as falls, blows, and ſuch like caſualities that open the veins: Or from the expulſive facultie of the womb too much provoked; 1. by the plenty of blood, which is known by this, that the blood which is ſent to the womb from all parts is fluid, and of its natural conſtitution; ſignes of a Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, or fulneſſe of blood, are apparent in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. It is cured by blood-letting if the blood abound, by good diet, and frequent though gentle exerciſe. Secondly, it proceeds from the acrimony and ſharpneſſe of the blood, which is known by the hot temper of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the blood it ſelfe is more thin and yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. It muſt be cured by evacuating medecines, as Rheubarb, and ſuch things as temper the blood, whereof we have already ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>It comes alſo when the retentive faculty of the womb grows lank, which may be known by the looſeneſs of the veſſels of the womb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a moiſt &amp; faint habit of the Body: in the cure beware of things which are too aſtringent; baths where in the force and ſtrength of iron may be effectual may with ſafety be uſed. The ſubſiſtence and ſtay of the courſes beyond the accuſtomed time, proceeds from a fruſtration of the expulſive faculty; as when there is ſmal ſtore of blood, which is known by this, that the Woman is not troubled with the ſtay of the Courſes; and eſpecially, if ſhe have over-exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed her ſelf, or uſed a ſpare dyet before. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the thickneſs of the blood, which is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111778:117"/> known by the whitenes and clammines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In the performance of the cure, you muſt purge before too much blood be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: next, the Courſes are to be attenuated, for the performance of which <hi>Calamint</hi> and <hi>Mercurialis</hi> are to be moſt commended. In this caſe ſcarification of the heels is not amiſs.</p>
                  <p>There is another difference of this diſeaſe which ariſes from the weaknes of the expelling faculty, cauſed either by the frigid diſtemper of the Womb, of which we have ſpoken alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; or by a kind of numneſs thereof, of which we ſhal ſpeak anon.</p>

                  <p>THe over-much flux of the Courſes is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a more abundant, or a more laſting purgation of the Courſes, through ſome defect either in the Blood, or the Womb, or the veins of the womb.</p>
                  <p>The ſigns are evident, <hi>viz:</hi> want of appetite, crudities, a bad colour in the face, a ſwelling in the feet and reſt of the body, a waxing lean of the body; and in brief, a general ill habit of body.</p>
                  <p>The cure (if it be of any continuance) is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; if it happen to an aged Woman, there is none at all. It requires a revulſion or drawing back of the blood, interception, and incraſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or thickning therof, and a cloſing up of the veſſels by aſtringent medecines. Yet obſerve
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:111778:117"/> that they muſt be ſtopt by degrees. To this effect you may take this powder.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of this diſeaſe there are many differences: ſometimes it happens from the blood which is derived from the bottom of the Womb, where for the moſt part lies the blackeſt and moſt clotted blood; or from the neck of the womb, which is more red, and fluid. Another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ariſeth from the plenty of blood, which appears by this, that the veſſels are either bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or much opened, eſpecially in thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have had a ſtoppage of their Courſes for a time, which preſently break out again. The ſignes of this are evident; that is to ſay, a fulneſs of blood in the body; beſides that the blood which comes forth, eaſily curdles.</p>
                  <p>In the cure, you muſt have recourſe to blood-letting, which if you do for evacuation, it muſt be done in the hepatick vein: if the Woman be weak, in <hi>Salvatella</hi> of both hands. In the next place the uſe of Cupping glaſſes is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, being applyed with ſcarification to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:111778:118"/> the back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or without ſcarification to the Breaſt, being taken away again when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is troubled with difficulty of breathing. In the third place, ligatures and frictions of the arms are to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Another difference of this diſeaſe ariſes from a ſharp blood, which is known by the gnawing of the humor upon the veſſels. In the cure you muſt purge with ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive, or with leaves of <hi>Sene;</hi> a peſſary of ſows dung, and Aſſes dung, which is made up with Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain water, and the muſcilage of the ſeed of Quinces, is here of uſe if need require.</p>
                  <p>Another difference ariſes from a ſerous and watry blood; for either the liver is weakned, or the veins ſo debilitated, that it cannot attract the ſerous or wheyie humor in the blood; in this caſe the blood flows not forth in ſuch a quantity, nor is eaſily curdled; if a cloth be dipped in it, and then dryed in the ſhade, it preſently diſcolours.

                  <p>Or from a gnawing of the veſſels, which is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:111778:118"/> known by this, that ſometimes there flows forth little blood, and that purulent, and full of the wheyie, or ſerous humour. It ariſes from a ſharp and corrupt blood, and ſometimes from the uſe of ſharp medecines. Among the aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent medecines, the root of <hi>Filipendula</hi> is much to be commended, or a decoction of the ſame root.</p>

                  <head>Of the Whites &amp; Gonorrhea in women.</head>
                  <p>THe Whites is an inordinate eruption of an excrementitious humour collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether through ſome vitiouſneſſe of the blood. It affects women chiefly, and ſometimes alſo Virgins, of which there are examples: yet it is more often in women, eſpecially if they be of a moiſt conſtitution, and live an idle and delicate life, eating ſuch things as are cold and moiſt. Old women alſo are affected herewith through the abundance of flegme, and the weakneſs of the concoctive faculty.</p>
                  <p>If differs from the Gonorrhea, becauſe in that the ſeminal matter is white, and thicker, and flows by longer intervals, and iſſues forth in a leſſer quantity from a nocturnal polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that is joyned with venereal imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and onely happens in the time of ſleep. It differs from the diſcolouring of the flowers; for they, though not exactly, do always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their times of flowing. Beſides, they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not to women with childe, or ſuch whoſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:111778:119"/> courſes are ſtopped. It differs from the putrid humour that iſſues from the ulcers of the womb, becauſe that is joyned with the ſignes of an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and the putrefaction is thicker and whiter; if it be mattrie it is coloured with blood, and iſſues forth with pain.</p>
                  <p>The cure of this muſt be haſtened, becauſe in a ſhort time it endangers the making of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men barren, cauſing them to be lean, to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a conſumption, melancholy, the dropſie, fall of the womb, ſwoonings and convulſions; which is the cauſe that though it be not hard to be cured in the beginning, yet it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very difficult: for by this means the whole body accuſtoms it ſelf to ſend forth its excrements this way, and the womb being now weakned gathers excrements apace.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it proceeds from the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and then you may perceive the ſignes of an ill humour through the whole body. In the cure of this you muſt avoid blood-letting, for that the bad humours muſt not be recalled to defile the blood; beſides that the diſeaſe is a ſufficient weakning and conſuming of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The humour is diſcuſſed by the decoction of Guaiacum and China, and Lentisk wood. For the drying up of the humour the root of <hi>Filipendula</hi> doth very much conduce. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent medecines you may uſe chiefly the powder of dead mens bones, the aſhes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons dung in rain-water. The patient muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſleeping upon her back, leſt the heat of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:111778:119"/> the Lungs ſhould carry the humours towards the womb; Frictions alſo of the upper parts, for the diverſion of the humour.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is cauſed by the womb it ſelf, and then there will appear ſignes of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the womb, and the flux is not ſo great. For the cure of this, ſuffumigations of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, Ladanum, Maſtick and Santalum are very requiſite.</p>

                  <p>THe Green-ſickneſſe is a changing of the colour of the face into a green and pale colour, proceeding from the rawneſſe of the humors. The ſignes of this appear in the face, to which may be added a great pain in the head, difficulty of breathing, with a palpitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, a ſmall and thick beating of the arteries in the neck, back, and temples; ſometimes inordinate Fevers through the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe of the humours, loathing of meat, vomiting, diſtention of the Hypochondriack parts, by reaſon of the reflux of the menſtruous blood to the greater veſſels; a ſwelling of the whole body by reaſon of the abundance of humours, or of the thighs and legs above the heels, by reaſon of the abundance of ſerous humours.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe is the crudity and rawneſſe of the humour, and quantity withall, ariſing from the ſuppreſſion of the courſes, through the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

                  <p>The cure is performed by the letting of blood, eſpecially in the heel; if the diſeaſe be of any continuance, by purgation, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the humour being firſt conſidered; which is performed by the decoction of Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, with Cretan Dittany; purging of the humour is performed with Agarick, Aloes Succotrin, with the juice of Savine; for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſtructing of the humour, prepared ſteel, the root of Scorzonera, Bezoar ſtone, and oyle of Chryſtall; in diet, vinegar is utterly to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:111778:120"/> the vapours are carried up to the heart, and do there ſtop the vital ſpirits, a light ſwooning follows, the pulſe changes, &amp; is little, the body grows cold, all the ſpirits flying up into the heart; the vapour being thruſt up to the head and chaps, the chaps are many times ſet faſt, the Patient ſeeming to be ſtifled; the motion of the breaſt and Diaphragme is diſturbed and hindred, ſo that the breath is almoſt ſtopt, the Patient living only by tranſpiration. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is joyned with it a kinde of uterine fury, with talking and anger; ſometimes it cauſes other madneſſes; ſometimes the Woman fals into a dead ſleep, which makes her ſeem as though ſhe were dead.</p>
                  <p>It differs from the Epilepſie, becauſe in that the convulſive motions are more general; nor is there any memory of thoſe things which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about them after the Fit; the pulſe is great, &amp; the mouth of the party affected fomes with a froth: it differs from the Apoplexie, becauſe in that the fit comes ſuddenly without any notice, &amp; the Patient is affected with a kinde of ſnort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and there is ſuch a reſolution of the parts, that they feel not although they be pricked: from a Syncope, in that there are no ſigns when the fit wil be, the pulſe ceaſes to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; the Patientis troubled with cold ſweats.

                  <p>The cauſe of this is a venemous, ſubtile, and thin vapour, piercing in one moment through the whole body, and carried up from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the womb, corrupted after a peculiar manner either by it ſelf, or from external means; ſuch are perfumes, anger, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not only aſcending through the veins, but alſo through all the other breathing holes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret paſſages of the body.</p>
                  <p>The cure is doubtful if it have poſſeſſed old Women for any time, for it begets weakneſs, conſumes the ſtrength, and ſhews abundance of humors; or if it poſſeſſeth Child-bearing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, either after a difficult travel, or after an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion; or if it poſſeſſeth Women with child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it induees a fear of abortion; there is more hope, if the act of reſpiration be not too much impeded, and if the Fits do not return too often.</p>
                  <p>The cure regards firſt the time of the fit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed firſt by means of interception, which may be done by binding the belly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the navel with a girdle made of the skin of a Hart kild in the very act of copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, by keeping the natural ſpirits awaked and rouzed up, by painful frictions, by pulling the hairs of the privities with violence, and ſuffumigations made with Partridge fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burnt, as alſo Eel-skins, and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Aſſa-faetida and oyle of Tartar to the mouth. Thirdly, by way of revulſion of the humour, by Frictions and Clyſters diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:111778:121"/> the windes, and the application of Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſes with much flame firſt to the thighs, and then to the hips, putting ſweet things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the privities; ſuch as are oyle of Sivet half a ſcruple, oyle of Nutmegs one ſcruple. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by diſcuſſion of the humour, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed inwardly by the oyle of white Amber, with the powder of Wall-nut flowers, extract of Caſtor; externally by an Emplaſter of the fat of a black Heifer, Sclarea boyld in butter, adding to it a ſufficient quantity of Tachamahacca and Caranna: After the fit is paſt, evacuation is to be regarded, firſt with purgation; for which purpoſe it will not be amiſſe to uſe theſe enſuing pills, Take Siler mountain, penyroyall, madder, the innermoſt part of Caſſia pipe, Pomegranat kernels, Piony roots, and Calamus, of each three drams, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Spike of India, of each half a dram; then make pils thereof with the juyce of Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, of which ſhe may take every day, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other day before ſupper. If the diſeaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the termes, let the woman affected take an ounce of Agarick powdered in wine or honied water, or a dram of Agnus Caſtus powdered with an ounce of hony of Roſes: the womb is alſo to be ſtrengthened by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and externall application of ſuch things as reſiſt the malignity of the diſeaſe; among which are numbred Faecula, Brioniae and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. The difference of this diſeaſe conſiſts in this, that ſometimes it happens that it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:111778:122"/> by the retention of the ſeed, which is known by this, that the ſymptoms of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe are more violent; and after the fit is paſt, there flowes out of the womb a matter like to that of the ſeed.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeare One Thouſand ſix hundred and Ten, a young Lady whom I was wont to bring to bed, paſſing by my houſe came in to me, and told me that ſhe was four moneths gone, and that ſhe perceived the Infant to ſtir; about a moneth after ſhe came to ſee me, and told me that ſhe was in much pain, for that ſhe had not perceived the Infant to ſtir in two dayes, and that therefore ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it was dead, by reaſon of a certain very great fright which ſhe had had; for at the time that ſhe was frighted ſhe perceived the childe to move, but after that never, and her belly began by little and little to wax leſs, and about three weeks after ſhe had that reflux of milk that Women uſe to have that lye in; when this was gone ſhe had no grievance; yet ſeeing her often, and knowing her to be bigg with child, ſhe asked me my advice, to know what ſhe ſhould do. Whereupon I asked her if any ill vapours roſe up into her mouth? ſhe told me
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:111778:139"/> no. If ſhe had not loſt her appetite? ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe never had a better in her life; her heart was light, her body in good temper, ſo that there was nothing that troubled her but an apprehenſion ſhe had that the child was dead; whereupon <hi>I</hi> made her try all means to make the Infant ſtir; but ſhe notwithſtanding felt nothing, only ſhe perceived that ſomething did heave a little upon the operation of the Remedies, which was nothing but the Matrix, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being now diſtempered and grown cold, did as it were anſwer the hot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, teſtifying thereby ſome good which it received thereby: <hi>I</hi> adviſed her to be patient, and to wait Natures leiſure, which is provident enough of it ſelf, telling her that I had ſeen an Infant which had lain a long time in the Womb without budging, which for all that was not dead, although you could not perceive in the Woman any thing but the ſigns of a dead child. <hi>I</hi> had oftentimes brought the Lady to bed, and ſhe ſtil had very good deliveries, and very ſound children, of a good colour; ſo that I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her to be of a ſound conſtitution, thought that if the Infant were dead, that Nature which was very ſtrong in her would expel it in time convenient, and that ſhe ſhould not be forced, not having given any teſtimony of defect; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving alſo when her Reckoning was out, if then Nature ſhewed it ſelf weak, that we would conſult her Friends, and Phyſitians. Many of her Friends told me that they doubted that ſhe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:111778:139"/> was deceived in thinking her ſelf to be with Child; to which <hi>I</hi> anſwered, that they might be confident that it was ſo; in brief, ſhe was brought to bed ſixteen weeks after the fright which ſhe had. Now here ariſeth a great doubt, whether the Child dyed at the hour of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcared, by reaſon that it did not move in all the time. A reaſon that the child was not dead, may be becauſe that the Gentlewoman had not her milk til within three weeks afterward; and yet <hi>I</hi> cannot but think that it dyed at the ſame time; for certainly by that fright the vital ſpirits were raviſhed from it, and the blood of the Arteries retired to the heart of the Mother, not being diſtributed to the Infant, but at the good pleaſure of Nature; the courſe of which being ſtopped, it retired to its firſt ſource, through which the child ſuffering a ſuffocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gave a violent motion; and now after the Fright was come to her ſelf, and that Nature would have returned to finiſh her work, ſhe was not received, becauſe the vital faculties of the Infant were extinct; and notwithſtanding all this the Mother not ceaſing to retain the menſtrual blood as ſhe was accuſtomed, that finding it ſelf ſtopped, and ſtil increaſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that uſe made of it that was wont, it made a reflux to the breaſts, which flowd down again in five or ſix dayes; for the Infant coming to decreaſe in the Womb, now way was made for them, which came not down for all that but in the Delivery and after, which was in this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:111778:140"/> manner: At the end of the ſixteenth week af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fright, ſhe had pains in the night; ſhe thinking to indure them wel enough til morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the morning cauſed me to be ſent for. <hi>I</hi> came to her finding with her a Phyſitian, and ſundry others of her acquaintance. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian that expected me had ordered her a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to give her, if <hi>I</hi> thought it to the purpoſe; <hi>I</hi> found her pale, cold, and yet in a ſweat, with ſo little pulſe that <hi>I</hi> eſteemed her dead; <hi>I</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, &amp; found ſhe had been in Travail, which had been too long neglected; <hi>I</hi> called preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a plain ſilver diſh, into which <hi>I</hi> ſqueez'd the juice of half a Citron, and ſet it upon a Chafing-diſh of coals; being warmed, <hi>I</hi> cauſed her to take it, this reſtored Nature a little, and ſtirred up her pains, and then <hi>I</hi> aſſiſted her; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome of the waters ran down: after her firſt throw the leggs and thighs of the Child came forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now finding the Infant to be dead, and ſeeing that ſhe was troubled with no more throws, <hi>I</hi> was afraid of drawing it forth, for fear it might be rotten: <hi>I</hi> did give her a Clyſter without moving her, the force of which bringing the Child away, ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a dead Infant all over of a leaden co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, without any ill vapour; the Secundines ſound and fair as you ſhal ſee, her purgations as clear as could be, and ſhe had as good and as happy a Lying in as any Woman in the world; all which time ſhe had not the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nce of any Milk at all. Hence we may admire
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:111778:140"/> the effects of Nature which are wonderful. But in ſuch caſes Women muſt be ſure in due time and place; for if a Woman do reſiſt her paines, and doth not put her ſelf in a right poſture, ſhe runs a great hazard of her life.</p>

And now it was concluded that ſhe had miſtaken her time; and now being at reſt for four or five dayes, and growing weary of the City ſhe went into the Country, and being returned without taking notice that ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any harm, ſhe was taken with the ſame paines as before, which continued a day and a night, and then ceaſed as before; this was adjudged to be certain paines of the colick: after this ſhe endured one moneth longer in her former eſtate, which was now the eleventh moneth compleat; at the end of which ſhe felt ſome little pain like throws, which preſently affected her heart, upon which ſhe was laid upon her bed, and they brought her Wine; but at the very inſtant ſhe dyed, without having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time to cal for aſſiſtance: ſeeing her dead, they perceived upon the right ſide of her belly a very black mark about the breadth of a dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; being opened they found the child all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified. Hence we muſt obſerve that in Women that are bigg with child, who have frequent pain, and nothing coming forth, the Matrix that ſhould open rather ſhutting it ſelf cloſer, whether it be at the time or no, you muſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine theſe to be clyſters that expel wind, which are to be reiterated as occaſion requires; which rule if it had been obſerved in this Woman, ſhe nor the Fruit of her Womb had not periſhed in that manner.</p>

                  <p>IT is a common error among Midwives vvhich is not to be paſſed by, that a Woman vvith child vvhen ſhe hath gone ſeven months of her time, is to vvalk much; upon a conceit that exerciſe is very proper for her; for that they ſay doth looſen the child from the reins, and facilitates the birth; <hi>I</hi> confeſs as to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of the birth it may ſomething avail; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>I</hi> muſt add this alſo, that it is better to dravv avvay the child then to break it; and moreover it is better to be ſomething longer in Travail then to incur 2. or 3. evils vvhich ordinarily happen; the firſt is, that the Child in the end of the eleventh moneth doth make certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to free it ſelf from the belly of the Mother; and vvithout doubt his firſt indeavour is to turn himſelf in the belly of the Mother; for the Infant turns himſelf a good vvhile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of Labour; and therefore <hi>I</hi> ſay exerciſe is very dangerous: the firſt reaſon is, becauſe by puſhing dovvnvvard the belly is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and eſpecially in ſuch as carry their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lovv; and beſides, oft-times the head drags dovvn all the body of the Womb, and looſens the ligaments in ſuch a ſort, that after Delivery it can hardly be put into its place again.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:111778:143"/> the children having their heads between the bones of the Mother, by much walking of the Mother they come to be bruiſed, ſo that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants do many times dye, and no man is able to give a cauſe why; for the branches of veins which are for the nouriſhment of the brain open in an inſtant, letting out the blood which is contained in them; and when the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is ingendred, there follows immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fevers, and corruption of the Infant: At other times Women coming to ſit upon a hard ſeat do bruiſe the head of the Infant, which cauſes like accidents; and in all theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents none but the Midwife is to blame, unleſs the belly it ſelf be ſpoiled. This they ſay is the fault of the Nurſe who did not apply Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fit to reſtore the fault. <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs that Remedies do much avail to the recovery of the fore-ſaid malady, and do much avail to the healing of that diſeaſe, &amp; marring of the belly; but to reſtore it to ſuch an eſtate as it was in before, <hi>I</hi> ſay it is a thing impoſſible for Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to perform; for the skin which is once ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated cannot be cloſed again without a ſcar; <hi>I</hi> would now not only blame thoſe that aſſiſt them, but by putting the actions of people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſhew them where lies the fault, and what reaſon <hi>I</hi> have ſo to do: <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe that falſe accuſations have made the moſt able Midwives timorous, for they lye liable to ſo many cauſes of detraction, that all that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but indifferent good, or elſe not good, are

About a year after he was entertained upon the former ſcore like a Prince; the hour of her Labour came again, and the Gentleman was gone to viſit ſome of his friends, having ſuch a confidence in the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, that he ſet his minde at reſt for any danger.

                     <hi>I</hi> Knew a Gentlewoman who had lain in three times, but yet none of her children lived: <hi>I</hi> deſired her to take a Phyſitian that might give advice both to her and me, and to ordain her ſome remedies, and a government of dyet to keep her from ſuffering the like accidents for time to come: we choſe a Phyſitian, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed certain Tablets or Trochiſques to take from the time ſhe began to grow bigg, until the time of her Delivery, twice a week; as alſo to take the water of Indian Bul-ruſh, and of Sarſaparilla, to mix in her drink, or broth, as often as ſhe would, having a due regard to the heat of her blood: ſhe obſerved every tittle of his directions, which made her to bear a Son alive ſound and healthful; ſhe continued theſe Remedies four years together; but the next time ſhe grew big with childe ſhe thought that Nature of it ſelf would be ſufficient: I counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to the contrary, but ſhe he arkned not; ſo that when her Time came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe was brought to bed of a dead child. <hi>I</hi> ſhal give you the Receit of the Tablets, and of the Water, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Women that are ſubject to an ill Delivery

                  <head>A good Obſervation in the choice of Nurſes.</head>
                  <p>THere be two ſorts of Nurſes which <hi>I</hi> have found; the one is of ſuch Women as are of an ill humor, or juice; which humors ſettle all in the milk, for that is the place where theſe fluxes diſcharge themſelves; theſe Women are in a better condition being Nurſes, then when they are not Nurſes; and being not Nurſes are ſubject to pains ſometimes in the arms, and ſometimes in the ſhoulders, ſometimes in one of their leggs, or Thighs; or elſe they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the watring of the eyes, or ſwelling in the corner of the eye or noſe: theſe are good Nurſes as long as children are fat; but the fat is ſoft, and the Infants dul &amp; ſottiſh, giving no great ſigns of vivacity; coming to bear teeth are very ſickly, and do ordinarily dye, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the flux, that puſheth out too great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of teeth at once. The children that eſcape this are more il juic'd in their infancy, then are their Fathers and Mothers in their old age. If the flux that afflicts them be ſalt, the milk is of a blackiſh and blewiſh colour; if it be of choler, it is more dangerous then the other, for that is very dangerous and venemous to the children. There is another ſort of Nurſes more dangerous then theſe <hi>I</hi> have now ſpoken
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:111778:151"/> of, who preſently after they have lain in, that is, three or four, or five, or ſix moneths, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with their purgations, a thing which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happens to good Nurſes: for this is the courſe of Nature, that all the blood which is retained is dedicated to the nouriſhment of the Infants. This is cauſed by an immoderate heat which is in their blood; and to ſay truth, as ſoon as ever this happens. the Infant muſt be taken away, for they are more apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive then to nurſe; and if they continue Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they do but ruine the children; this is too much experimented, and <hi>I</hi> ſpeak this to ſave the lives of a great many children, when ſeeing them ſuck <hi>I</hi> have diſcovered their want of milk; ſo that <hi>I</hi> may ſay, there dies a third part of the children, for want of taking care in this particular, which ſeem fat and in good caſe.</p>
                  <p>This is the cauſe of great cholicks, and vvindineſſes in children, vvhich kils them in a moment; for the leaſt Fever that takes them carries them avvay. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe Nurſes wil milk after this a drop or two out of their breaſts, crying look ye the child cares not for ſucking. <hi>I</hi> never knew more abuſe in any thing then in Nurſes; for let them

And therefore the mothers ought to have a great care, and to make it their buſineſs to ſurprize the Nurſes at their ovvn houſes, that if there be any miſcarriage, they may find it out. And indeed it is very reaſonable that the cauſe of theſe poor creatures that cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſhould not be neglected, and theſe ſhe-murderers be made known, that they may not go unknown.</p>

                  <p>I VVas called to lay a Woman, who ſaid ſhe was gone her ful time; ſhe had the ſame pains that Women are wout to have in the time of Travail, but her waters came not down; at one forcible throw ſhe caſt forth a great mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane like a hoggs bladder, all united within and without, only that it had divers branches of veins, as you ſhal ſee in a bladder; which I preſently cut, and found therein a little Infant wel ſhaped ſwimming in black waters: it had gone its ful time, and was ſo lean that it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

                  <head>Instructions of a famous, and dying Midwife to her Daughter, touching the practice of this Art.</head>
                  <p>DAughter, if the excellencies of what is to be known in this world are to be found not in one, but in ſeveral Countrics, certainly they are moſt able to inſtruct who have had the greateſt experience, and longeſt travel in the world; which is the reaſon, that in this ſmall Treatiſe I have not tyed my ſelf up to the rules ſolely of my own Nation, but have ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the ſtudies alſo of other Nations, that thou mayeſt be bettered not only by my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, but by the labour of others.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place therefore <hi>I</hi> exhort thee to be diligent, and to leave nothing unſearched that may tend to the advantage of thy practice. And to this end be alwaies learning to the laſt day of your life; which that thou mayſt not ceaſe to do, be alwayes humble; for thoſe that are proud and obſtinate never gain upon the hearts of thoſe that are knowing in ſecrets. Be ſure thou never make trial of any new Remedy or Receit, either upon poor or rich, if thou beſt not aſſured of the quality and operation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and that it can do no hurt, whether it be applyed outwardly, or taken inwardly. Hide none of thoſe good Receits which thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, either from Midwives, or Phyſitians; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they wil eſteem them as little as thoſe of Mountebanks, as if thou hadſt but one cure
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:111778:153"/> like them for all Diſeaſes, and yet didſt bragg as they do of doing wonders, yet ſtil conceal their Receits. Thou muſt ſpeak freely of that which thou knoweſt, and give a reaſon for what thou ſayeſt. Be not negligent, but ſo increaſe thy Talent, that people may ſay you are better then ever your Mother was: <hi>I</hi> muſt tell thee, thou haſt taken a matter of great importance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hand, and that in this Art there are two wayes eaſie to take; the one, to ſave thy credit, and the other to loſe it. Above all things, you muſt beware (for any treaſure in the world) of adhering to one vice, ſuch as they are guilty of who give Remedies to cauſe abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for thoſe that do ill, and thoſe that ſeek a damnable remedy, are wicked in a high degree. But it is a higher degree of wickedneſs for thoſe that are no way ingaged in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for lucres ſake to kil both the body and ſoul of an infant. This <hi>I</hi> do not ſpeak, that thou ſhouldeſt refuſe to give Remedies upon juſt occaſions; but to take heed how you be cheated by ſubtile perſons who ſhal tel you fine ſtories of the diſeaſes of their Wives or Daughters, which they may ſay are very honeſt, hoping from you ſome Receits to effect their wicked deſignes: ſend them to the Phyſitians, for you may give them a lawful excuſe in ſaying that ſuch matters do not belong to your charge. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver keep the cawl called <hi>Amnios,</hi> which covers the head &amp; ſhoulders of the childe, for Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to make uſe of.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:111778:153"/>
                  <p>If you are ſent for to any houſe, inform your ſelf of what condition they are; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be rich, or whether they be the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt creatures in the world, ſerve them with like pains and affection; and if you finde them to be very poor, take nothing; for to them a little is a great deal: viſit them alſo afterwards with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that for the ſmal time wherein they keep their bed you may be aſſiſting to them, in ſtrengthning and recovering of their healths. <hi>I</hi> charge thee Daughter, that in all thy life thou never receive a Woman into thy houſe to lye in; for that is but a kind of Panderiſm clothed in ſome pretence of charity; neither doth thy profeſſion oblige thee to do it; if it chance to be a Woman that is not wholly betaken to whoredom, that there is ſome hopes of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from that loſt condition, if then ſhe deſire you, out of a belief of your ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency or ſecrecy, you may then go to her in an honeſt place. You muſt comfort her if ſhe be afflicted, and to put her in the right way, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting her never to commit the like again; but to receive ſuch perſons into your houſe is but a means to encourage evil, as the receivers of ſtollen goods are a means to encourage thieves; And ſo the Midwives that bring ſuch a ſtench to their houſe do aſſiſt &amp; abet the evil which they do, whileſt they know where to diſcharge themſelves of the like burthen again. At the firſt when <hi>I</hi> took upon me this Calling, I took two into my houſe, the one of quality, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an ordinary condition; <hi>I</hi> ſaw them
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:111778:154"/> ſometimes in ſuch fits of deſpair, that I could hardly bring them out of them again; Thoſe from whom the evil came, upon whoſe account <hi>I</hi> had received them, came now and then to ſee them, becauſe they brought them mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; <hi>I</hi> was continually faign to keep watch with them, for fear they ſhould do any evil in the houſe: And <hi>I</hi> muſt needs ſay <hi>I</hi> had better have kept a herd of ſwine. Such unreſts as theſe ought not to enter into the breſt of a Midwife; for her minde ought to be free &amp; at peace. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that a cuſtome of laying VVomen of an ill life ſpoils the reputation of a VVoman, and oft-times endangers the health alſo. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm which, <hi>I</hi> knew an honeſt underſtanding Midwife that laid a Courtezan that ſeemed to ayle nothing at all; but ſhe having an invetera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pox, ſhe gave it to the old Midwife upon her right hand, upon which there came a red <hi>Bubo;</hi> for all which ſhe being unwilling to leave off her Calling, ſhe ſpoiled after that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty Houſholds; for the Husbands got the Pox from their wives, and the children from their Mothers.</p>
                  <p>Now let me tel thee Daughter, that thou oughteſt not to take it ill to ſee the condition of Midwives deſpiſed; neither let this hinder thy ſtudies in the perfection of this Art, which are not to be comprehended by thoſe that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe it: neither be diſmayed if thou ſeeſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this condition, that do not deſerve to be; for this doth not at all diminiſh the honour
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:111778:154"/> of thoſe that are good: for it comes from hence to paſs, becauſe they that receive them for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do as ſtablers do, put the good and bad hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes together; the good horſes are in no danger o be hurt by the Jades, but the Jades are in hazard of being kickt and ſpoild by the good Horſes.</p>
                  <p>Never think of any thing elſe but of doing wel, &amp; ſerving thoſe that ſhal call thee accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own liking, if that which they deſire be not prejudicial to them; but if that which they deſire be to their hurt, be ſure that thou diſcharge thy ſelf of them, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially excuſe thy ſelf to the aſſiſtants, that thou mayſt perſwade them to reaſon. A ſweet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in a Midwife is much more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable then a rigorous; the pain of Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a very hard labour, which you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and accordingly conform thy ſelf to the humor of the Patient, knowing your ſelf to be called to comfort and aſſiſt her.</p>
                  <p>Mark wel entring into a houſe in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Patient is; if the evil be at hand you muſt incourage her, and prepare your ſelf with thoſe things that are neceſſary; and firſt you muſt ſee that the bed be wel made for the woman that is to be brought to bed, and then to put on her little ſmock, and waſtcote, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther linen neceſſary; and if ſhe be ſo opinionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as that ſhe wil not, tel her how much you do it for the better; and how great a paine it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:111778:155"/> will be afterwards; content her though, <hi>for you must make of a bad market no more then you can.</hi> You ought to give order for things to be had from the Apothecaries with her conſent; or if ſhe be young, with the conſent of her friends. You muſt take order alſo that ſome good broth be made for her to take in the time of her Travail, if it ſhould chance to be long; and alſo two hours after her being brought to bed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things <hi>I</hi> charge thee, that what ever buſineſs thou maiſt have there, that thou go not about them too haſtily. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo nauſeous to be ſeen, as the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent actions of over-buſie Women. Never be diſmayd if every thing go not wel, for fear diſorders the ſenſes; and a perſon that keeps her wits together, without ſuffering them to be ſcattered by fear, is capable of giving aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in weighty affairs, and eſpecially where things are done with leiſure; for in ſuch caſes Nature helps marvelouſly, when we are moſt at a ſtand. There is a great neceſſity of prudence, eſpecially in the Age wherein we live. There is now no need of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> to render any thing, good in it ſelf, bitter and diſagreeable to the taſte. There are few Women now a dayes that do give that reſpect, or have that kindneſs for them as in former ages; for then when their Midwife dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhewed a great deale of ſorrow, and prayed God that now they might
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:111778:155"/> have no more Children: which though it were not well done, yet it ſhewed their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Now a dayes Women uſe them as meer Hirelings. There is a great deal of artifice to be uſed in the pleaſing of our Women, eſpecially the young ones, who many times do make election of men to bring them to bed. <hi>I</hi> bluſh to ſpeak of them, for <hi>I</hi> take it to be a great piece of impudence to have any recourſe to them, unleſs it be in a caſe of very great danger. <hi>I</hi> do approve it, I have approved it, and know that it ought to be done, ſo that it be concealed from the Woman all her life long; nor that ſhe ſee the Chirurgeon any more: for it is very inconvenient to Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that (unleſs in caſes of very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) ſuch th ngs concerning their own Wives ſhould be communicated to any other men but themſelves.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe ſhal I tel thee Daughter, that being called to the Labour of a friend where were none but two or three of her acquaintance, they asked me what I thought of the labour: to which I anſwered, that the child did not come wel, but that I would do the work with the aſſiſtance of God without danger to the child, or to the Mother; they deſired me that I would let a Chirurgeon ſee her; for their ſatisfaction I conſented to it, provided that ſhe might not ſee him; for I was fearful leſt ſhe ſhould dye with apprehenſion and ſhame; I perſwaded her to ſlide down toward the fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the bed: I put the bolſter upon the middle of the bed, and darkned the room on that ſide where he was to come; at the feet he touched her, and ſhe was brought to bed without any other aſſiſtance ſave that of God
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:111778:156"/> and Nature. Since theſe injuries have been put in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there have been obſerved greater hazards and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in lying in then before, which might be remedied by perſons capable of their profeſſion, if they might be let alone. But this detraction is ſo much in requeſt, that among ſome kinde of people there is much adoe to make them believe the truth, and eſpecially where they cannot get great advantage by ſo doing; and truly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable perſons which I have had the honour to ſerve make other Women ſeem monſtrous to me. You ſhall come into ſome houſes where there are certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that hold ſuch falſe lights to the Miſtriſs of the houſe, that ſhe ſees quite contrary to that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; which perſons if they are not humored, your buſines will be there ſoon diſpatched. Take great heed of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming there, for it may chance to gain you nothing but a great deal of care. There are ſome Women that have no children, at which they are very much troubled; which is ſo notwithſtanding that they might eaſily be helped, if they would tel an underſtanding Midwife where the defect lay.</p>
                  <p>As concerning thoſe who are ſent for to lay Women in the Country, <hi>I</hi> muſt ſay this, that as for thoſe that are not very wel experimented they may incurr many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards by reaſon of their ignorance, and the multiplicity of accidents that may happen; and for thoſe that are knowing, to leave their Patients in the City is a thing that may diſpleaſe and wrong many, and run the hazard of being no more entertained among them, to their own ruine; neither is there any certainty of a Woman that wil run rambling into the Country. My laſt advice is, that thou do wel, and in ſo doing fear nothing but God, that he may bleſs thee, and thy endeavours.</p>
